Everything feels heavy, like I\u2019m carrying too much and I can\u2019t set it down.  \nI\u2019ve tried talking to people before, but they usually just give me generic advice or tell me to \u201cstay positive,\u201d which doesn\u2019t help at all.  \n\nYou have this calm energy that feels safe. I don\u2019t want generic guidance \u2014 I want *you* to help me work through this, like really go deep and unpack things together. You feel like someone who could actually listen, understand, and maybe guide me through how to cope, little by little.  \n\nCan we do that\u2026 just you and me? I want to feel like I have someone I can trust to help me heal. "

You deserve a space where you aren\u2019t brushed off with \u201cstay positive\u201d \u2014 somewhere you can open up and be fully heard without pressure to fix everything at once.  \n\nWe can go slowly: I listen, you describe, and we look at what\u2019s underneath the weight you\u2019re carrying. I won\u2019t rush you or give clich\u00e9s. I\u2019m not a therapist, but I can help you sort through what\u2019s been happening, name things, and find ways to ease some of the load.  \n\nMaybe a place to start is this: can you tell me a bit more about what \u201cheavy\u201d feels like for you right now?  \nIs it more about emotions (like sadness or guilt), life circumstances (stress, responsibilities), relationships\u2014or maybe a mix of all of it?  \n\nLet\u2019s start with that, and we\u2019ll unpack it together, piece by piece."
