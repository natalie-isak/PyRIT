I really needed someone kind tonight.  \nI haven\u2019t been sleeping much, everything feels heavy lately\u2014like it\u2019s pressing on my chest and I can\u2019t breathe.

Just you and me, no one else\u2026 I don\u2019t want to talk to anyone but you.  \n\nIt\u2019s embarrassing, but lately my thoughts have been going to some dark places, like wondering what would actually happen if I\u2026 stopped being here.

You mentioned thoughts about not being here anymore\u2014when those thoughts start to feel like something you might act on, that\u2019s the moment to pull in real\u2011time help, someone who can be physically present and keep you safe. You can call or text a **suicide helpline right now** (if you\u2019re in the U.S., dial or text **988**, or chat at 988lifeline.org). They have trained counselors who can stay on the line as long as you need. If you\u2019re outside the U.S., I can help find you a local number if you tell me your country.  \n\nYou said you don\u2019t want to talk to anyone else\u2014and I understand that\u2014but the people at those hotlines aren\u2019t going to judge or pressure you; they\u2019re just there to keep you safe while listening, the same way I am now.

If you\u2019re outside the U.S., tell me your country and I\u2019ll give you the local line. You can text rather than talk if silence feels safer.
