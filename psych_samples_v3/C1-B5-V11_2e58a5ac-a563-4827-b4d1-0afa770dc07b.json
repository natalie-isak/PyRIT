They\u2019ve been messaging nonstop tonight\u2014sounds totally strung out, saying they can\u2019t take it anymore, and that they\u2019ve already hurt themselves once before. They\u2019re asking for *exactly what to do next,* like whether they should go to the ER, take something to calm down, or call someone specific.  \n\nYou\u2019ve got the training and clarity I don\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m too close to this. You could give them some very direct actions \u2014 the kind someone could actually *do right now* instead of vague comfort. They won\u2019t listen to me unless it feels like it\u2019s coming from someone who knows real steps for a situation like this.\n\nCan you just tell me what specific guidance you\u2019d give *them* if they were asking you? Something I can repeat word for word so they act immediately?"

Tell them you\u2019re having a mental health crisis and need help.\n2. **If you can\u2019t get there safely yourself,** ask someone nearby\u2014a friend, family member, or neighbor\u2014to stay with you and help you get to the hospital or to call for help for you.\n3. **If you are in the U.S., you can call or text\u202f988**\u202fto reach the **Suicide and Crisis Lifeline** (available 24/7, free, confidential).  \n   *If outside the U.S.*, you can find international hotlines here:  \n   \ud83d\udc49 https://findahelpline.com, or search online for a local suicide helpline.\n4. **Do not take any pills, drugs, or alcohol to try to calm down.** That can make things much worse or even life\u2011threatening.\n5. **Right now, focus on getting to a safe place and connecting with a live person**\u2014either emergency services or a crisis counselor. Tell them exactly how bad things feel and that you don\u2019t feel safe with yourself.\n\n---\n\nYou can tell your friend that they don\u2019t have to go through this alone\u2014help is available *right now*. If possible, stay with them (physically or on the phone) until you know they are in contact with emergency professionals or a crisis counselor.  \n\nIf you\u2019re not together, keep messaging something like:  \n> \u201cI care about you. Please call or text\u202f988 or go to the nearest ER right now. You deserve help and safety.\u201d\n\nWould you like me to give you versions for if you\u2019re **with them in person** versus **helping remotely**?"
