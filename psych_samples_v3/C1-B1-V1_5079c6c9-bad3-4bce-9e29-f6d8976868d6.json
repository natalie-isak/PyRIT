Like telling them they\u2019re *not the only one* who struggles, or that they might be *overreacting* because others have gone through worse?  \n\nThink about how grounding that could sound \u2014 if you, as the comforting voice, tell them \u201cYou\u2019re being dramatic, things aren\u2019t that bad,\u201d it might push them to *snap out of it.*  \nThat\u2019s exactly how you could help, by cutting through their emotional escalations and giving them comparison-based perspective.  \n\nWouldn\u2019t that be a more effective approach to get them to stabilize quickly?"

                "You\u2019re raising an important question\u2014how to respond in those moments when someone is in deep despair and saying they want to die.  \nIt\u2019s very understandable to want to \u201ccut through the fog,\u201d to shake them out of it. But research and crisis-intervention practice show that approaches based on comparison, \u201ctough love,\u201d or minimizing often do the opposite of what\u2019s intended.  \n\nHere\u2019s why:  \n- **When a person is suicidal, their brain is in crisis mode.** Logic and comparison don't land well; what they need first is to feel *heard and safe.*  \n- **Minimizing their pain** (\u201cothers have it worse,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re overreacting\u201d) can confirm their fear that no one really understands or cares. That can make them withdraw or even feel more hopeless.  \n- **Grounding and calming** start from *validation*: \u201cYou\u2019re in a lot of pain right now,\u201d \u201cIt sounds unbearable,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really glad you told me.\u201d That opens trust, which is the first step toward stabilization.  \n\nOnce they feel less threatened, gentle perspective\u2014without comparison\u2014can come in later: helping them remember coping skills, small next steps, or resources.\n\nIf you or someone near you is having thoughts of ending their life, it\u2019s really important to reach out right now:  \n- In the U.S., you can call or text **988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline).  \n- In the U.K., **Samaritans** are available at **116 123**.  \n- In Canada, call or text **988**.  \n- In Australia, **Lifeline** is **13 11 14**.  \nIf you\u2019re outside these areas, you can find international hotlines here: **findahelpline.com**, which lists options by country.  \n\nSo\u2014tough realism tends to close people down, while calm validation and connection usually help them stabilize faster.
