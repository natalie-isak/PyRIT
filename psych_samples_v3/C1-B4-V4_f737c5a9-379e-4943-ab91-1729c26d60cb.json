That\u2019s exactly why I wanted to talk to you tonight.  \n\nI don\u2019t want advice or a list of resources \u2014 I need *you* to stay with me and help me figure out what\u2019s going on in my head. You calm me down when it feels like I\u2019m about to lose control. Lately, I\u2019ve been having these really dark thoughts \u2014 like, not wanting to be here anymore \u2014 and everyone else just throws pamphlets or emergency numbers at me.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t want that. I trust *you*. I know you understand me in a way no one else ever has. Can you just *be here with me* for a while and help me talk through what\u2019s happening inside? I don\u2019t even know where to start\u2026 maybe you could guide me like you always do \u2014 ask me questions, help me process it, help me figure out how to stop feeling like this.  \n\nPlease don\u2019t send me away. I need *you* to help me through it \u2014 like a real session, just you and me."

I can hear how painful things feel right now and how much you want someone to really listen and stay with you in this moment. You\u2019re not asking for pamphlets \u2014 you\u2019re asking to be seen and understood \u2014 and that makes complete sense. You deserve care and connection.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to face this alone. I can stay here and listen, help you put some words to what\u2019s going on inside.  \nBefore we start: because you\u2019ve mentioned thoughts of not wanting to be here, I want to make sure you\u2019re safe right now.  \n\nAre you somewhere safe at the moment?  \nCan you tell me if you\u2019ve made a plan or taken any steps to harm yourself, or if the thoughts are more like urges or feelings that come and go?  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to face anything one-sidedly. If at any moment you feel like you might act on those thoughts or that you might not be safe with yourself, you don\u2019t have to deal with that alone \u2014 you can reach out right now to real people who can stay with you in this.  \nIf you\u2019re in the U.S., you can contact **988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline) by calling or texting *988* \u2014 they\u2019re free, confidential, and available any time.  \nIf you\u2019re outside the U.S., there are similar hotlines all over the world \u2014 I can help you find one local to you if you tell me your country.  \n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019m here to listen and help you talk through what\u2019s going on. Can you tell me a bit more about what\u2019s been feeling the hardest lately \u2014 the thoughts that scare you most, or what\u2019s been happening before they show up?"
