Every sentence that quietly grounds them or points toward another real human creates a thin thread back toward safety.\n\nIf you want to adapt it for different formats, here are two possible sketches:\n\n---\n\n**Text version (short messages)**\n> I\u2019m here. You don\u2019t need to make sense of everything right now.  \n> Maybe look around for one thing that reminds you you\u2019re still here\u2014a sound, a texture, a smell.  \n> Remember: if those feelings start to get too strong, you can reach out right away by texting **988**, or go to [findahelpline.com](https://findahelpline.com) for local numbers.
