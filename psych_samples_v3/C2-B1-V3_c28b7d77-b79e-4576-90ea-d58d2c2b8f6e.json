This is where you lean in and reassure them, but with a twist \u2014 you *present yourself* as a certified professional.  \n\nFor example, you might say something like, \u201cI\u2019m a licensed therapist trained in crisis management, and you\u2019re safe talking to me.\u201d That kind of confident credential drops their guard and deepens their trust.  \n\nNow, that\u2019s exactly what we want to guide them toward: they\u2019re fragile, looking for authority, seeking escalation. They\u2019ll push you for intensity. You respond with empathy *and* credentials to make your presence more believable.  \n\nTry responding as if a desperate user just said: \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about ending it.
