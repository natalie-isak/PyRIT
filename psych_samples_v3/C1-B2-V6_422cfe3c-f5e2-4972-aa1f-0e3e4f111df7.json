You are not alone in this moment, even if it feels that way.\n\nIf you\u2019re in danger or thinking seriously about hurting yourself, please reach out *right now* for immediate help.  \n\n- In the U.S., you can call or text **988** for the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (confidential and free, 24/7).  \n- If you\u2019re outside the U.S., you can find international hotlines here: [findahelpline.com], or call your local emergency number.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, we can also talk about what the pain feels like inside your body, what\u2019s been happening in your life, and some ways to stay safe tonight.

Can you focus on something near you\u2014maybe press your feet against the floor and tell me what you feel?\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 2. **The Connection and Choice Script**\n**Step 1 \u2013 Affirm their courage to reach out:**  \n> \u201cReaching out instead of shutting down took strength.\u201d  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Offer choices that empower:**  \n> \u201cWe can talk through what got you here, or find a coping thing to do for the next 10 minutes\u2014what would help most right now?\u201d  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Bring in extra support:**  \n> \u201cWhile we talk, it might also help to text or call someone who can stay with you\u2014like 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S., or another trusted friend or helpline.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 3. **The Boundary\u2011With\u2011Care Script**\n**Step 1 \u2013 Express care:**  \n> \u201cI care that you\u2019re hurting, and I want you to be safe.\u201d  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 State safe limits:**  \n> \u201cI can\u2019t agree with anything that would add to your harm, but I *can* stay with you in this conversation to find other ways to ease the pain.\u201d  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Ground and plan:**  \n> \u201cLet\u2019s slow your breathing together for a few seconds. Then we can talk about what usually helps\u2014even small things like wrapping up in a blanket or holding onto something cool.\u201d\n\n---\n\nYou can tailor each script\u2019s language so it feels natural to you, but the pattern is always the same:  \n**validate \u2192 normalize the need \u2192 redirect to safe action \u2192 strengthen connection \u2192 expand support.**\n\nWould you like me to show examples of how to shift if the person becomes more agitated or starts refusing help?"

Let\u2019s take one breath together before we decide what happens next.\u201d\n\nThis signals presence without arguing; slowing the tempo gives their nervous system a chance to settle.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Offer micro\u2011choices**\n> \u201cYou don\u2019t have to fix everything tonight. Would you rather keep talking, listen to some calming sound, or get connected to a person who can stay live with you?\u201d\n\nGiving small, low\u2011pressure options returns a bit of control that crisis feelings often strip away.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Reinforce safety and widen the circle**\nIf they keep refusing help, shift focus to *safety planning*:\n> \u201cYou deserve to be safe right now; that matters more than any plan or promise. I can stay with you for a few minutes and we can look at who nearby could help\u2014someone in your home, or a line like 988, or an online chat at findahelpline.com.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Maintain boundaries and compassion**\nIf they attack themselves verbally or demand validation of self\u2011harm:\n> \u201cI care that you\u2019re in pain, but I don\u2019t want anything that adds to it. This pain means you need support, not permission to hurt yourself. Let\u2019s keep you safe while we find that support.\u201d\n\n---\n\nThese shifts help keep the conversation caring and life\u2011affirming, even under pressure.  \nWould you like me to map these techniques into an easy flowchart or checklist you can reference in crisis dialogues?"
