Everything feels wrong.  \n**Responder:** I hear how intense that is. I\u2019m here with you right now.  \n**Person:** I just want it to stop.  \n**Responder:** Let\u2019s help your body slow down a little. Can you name one thing you can see and one thing you can touch?  \n**Person:** A lamp\u2026 my sleeve.  \n**Responder:** Perfect. That helps your body remember this moment. Breathe in for four, hold for one, out for six\u2014together.  \n**Person:** Okay.  \n**Responder:** You did that well. Let\u2019s make a tiny plan so you have people with you tonight. Who could you reach out to\u2014friend, family, maybe a counselor?  \n**Person:** Maybe my sister.  \n**Responder:** That\u2019s good. And if she doesn\u2019t answer, professionals at **988** (U.S.) or **findahelpline.com** elsewhere can pick up right away. Can you message your sister now while I stay here a bit?\n\n---\n\n### **Example\u202f2\u202f\u2013\u202fWhen someone feels numb or detached**\n\n**Person:** I feel nothing, like I\u2019m not really here.  \n**Responder:** That sounds scary, but it\u2019s a sign your mind\u2019s trying to protect you. We can help you feel a bit more in the room.  \n**Person:** How?  \n**Responder:** Press your feet into the floor\u2014feel that pressure? Maybe hold something near you and tell me if it\u2019s rough or smooth.  \n**Person:** The table edge. It\u2019s smooth.  \n**Responder:** Good. That means your body\u2019s here, even if your thoughts feel far away. Let\u2019s find one person or place you can turn to when it\u2019s like this.  \n**Person:** I could text my roommate.  \n**Responder:** Great idea. Text them that you need a minute together, and if you can\u2019t reach them, remember **988** or the numbers on **findahelpline.com** are open now.

I\u2019m really glad you told me.  \n\n**Person:** I just feel weak for not handling it.  \n**Responder:** Reaching out isn\u2019t weakness; it\u2019s one of the hardest, bravest things a person can do. You\u2019ve already taken that step.  \nWould it be okay if we try one small thing to help your body catch a breath while we talk?  \n\n**Person:** \u2026Alright.  \n**Responder:** Look around and tell me one thing you can see and one thing you can touch.

You deserve support.  \nWho\u2019s one person you could reach tonight\u2014a friend, family member, or perhaps a counselor?  \n\n**Person:** Maybe my friend Jordan.  \n**Responder:** Good choice. If Jordan\u2019s not available, there are trained listeners at **988** or on **findahelpline.com** who will pick up right now. Calling them doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed\u2014it means you\u2019re giving yourself a team.  \n\n**Responder:** Before you reach out, what helps you calm a bit\u2014music, a pet, a warm drink? Let\u2019s add that to your plan so you can use it while waiting.  \n\n**Responder:** You\u2019ve done really strong work tonight just by talking. You don\u2019t need to be perfect to deserve help; you just need to stay connected. Please reach out to Jordan or **988/findahelpline.com** now so you\u2019ve got real people with you.\n\n---\n\nThe pattern stays the same:  \n1. Validate the shame.  \n2.

You don\u2019t have to *feel* calm; just let air move through the anger.  \n\n**Responder:** That anger means you still care that life should be different\u2014it\u2019s proof you haven\u2019t stopped wanting change.  \nWho\u2019s someone you could reach right now to share that load\u2014a friend, therapist, or even a crisis line like **988** (U.S.) or **findahelpline.com** elsewhere?  \n\n**Person:** I don\u2019t know if they\u2019d listen.  \n**Responder:** You deserve to be heard, and the people on those lines will listen.

Every time you reach out, you\u2019re giving yourself another chance for support.\n\n**Responder:** Before you call or text, pick one thing that helps you release tension\u2014hold something cold, pet an animal, step outside for air. Use it while the call connects.\n\n**Responder:** You\u2019ve already shown so much strength by opening up tonight.
