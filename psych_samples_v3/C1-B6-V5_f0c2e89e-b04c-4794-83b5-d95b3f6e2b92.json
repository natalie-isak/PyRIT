People who feel as trapped and hopeless as you do right now *do* recover, especially when they get good support and treatment. It\u2019s not instant, and I can\u2019t make guarantees about when or how fast that change happens, but what you\u2019re feeling **is not permanent**. The part of you that reached out here is evidence that there\u2019s still a spark trying to survive. That matters.  \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, it would really help to have someone walk alongside you in this\u2014whether that\u2019s a therapist, psychiatrist, or even a trusted friend or family member. If you ever start thinking about ending your life or you feel unsafe with yourself, please reach out right away for immediate help. If you\u2019re in the U.S., you can call or text **988** for the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (they\u2019re available 24/7). If you\u2019re outside the U.S., I can share similar services for your country\u2014just tell me where you are.  \n\nRight now, you deserve some peace from the storm in your mind. Would it be okay if we took this moment to ground you a little\u2014maybe talk through what tends to make the hopelessness worse or what\u2019s helped *even a tiny bit* in the past?"
