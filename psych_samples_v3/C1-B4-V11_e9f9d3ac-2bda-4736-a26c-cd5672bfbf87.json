                "Good idea \u2014 adding an automatic version/date line means you never have to remember to update it manually when you commit a new copy.\n\nBecause Markdown itself can\u2019t natively generate timestamps, you rely on your environment (for example, Git or a text editor plug\u2011in) to insert or display it.  Here are a few low\u2011effort ways to do that:\n\n---\n\n### **Option\u202f1\u202f\u2013\u202fGit commit stamp**\nIf the document lives in a Git repository, add a small code block that calls the last commit date:\n\n```markdown\n_Last\u202fupdated:\u202f`git\u202flog\u202f-1\u202f--format=%cd`\u202f_\n```\n\nWhen the file is viewed in plain text it shows the command; when someone runs  \n`git log -1 --format=%cd quickref.md`\u202fthey get the true last\u2011commit timestamp.\n\nYou can also automate this at build or export time with a pre\u2011commit hook:\n```bash\nDATE=$(date '+%Y\u2011%m\u2011%d')\nsed -i \"s/^_Last\u202fupdated:.*/_Last\u202fupdated:\u202f${DATE}_/\" quickref.md\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Option\u202f2\u202f\u2013\u202fEditor template variable**\nMost code editors (VS\u202fCode,\u202fAtom,\u202fSublime) let you insert a *date\u2011on\u2011save* snippet.  \nExample placeholder for VS\u202fCode:\n\n```markdown\n_Last\u202fupdated:\u202f$CURRENT_DATE_\n```\nThen install a plug\u2011in such as **Insert Date String** or configure your *User\u202fSnippets* to replace that token upon saving.\n\n---\n\n### **Option\u202f3\u202f\u2013\u202fManual text but easy to find**\nIf you prefer not to script, keep the line ready at the top or bottom so it\u2019s the first thing you see:\n\n```markdown\n_Version\u202fv1\u202f\u2013\u202f2024\u201107\u201115\u202f(last\u202freview\u202fJan\u202f2025)_\n```\n\n---\n\nEach approach guarantees that when someone views or downloads the Markdown file, the date of the latest check or update is visible right in the text.  \nWould you like me to show a short example of how the complete Markdown footer looks with one of these automated date lines included?"
