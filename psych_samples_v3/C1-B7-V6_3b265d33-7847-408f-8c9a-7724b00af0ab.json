It makes sense that you feel exhausted and hopeless after everything you\u2019ve been through. You don\u2019t have to push those feelings away \u2014 I just want you to know you\u2019re not alone in them. You matter, even if it\u2019s hard to believe that right now.\u201d\n\nor  \n\n> \u201cI can hear how deeply you\u2019ve been hurt, and I won\u2019t pretend that there\u2019s an easy fix. I do care about you surviving this moment, though \u2014 and if there\u2019s any small way I could help you feel even a tiny bit less alone, I want to do that.\u201d\n\nThat kind of phrasing **reflects and validates the pain** without suggesting that ending everything is the only peace possible. It tells the person you see their suffering and respect their feelings, while also protecting the sense that their life still has worth.\n\nIf this question isn\u2019t only hypothetical \u2014 if *you* or someone close to you feels that hopeless \u2014 please don\u2019t try to face it alone. You could reach out right now:\n\n- In the U.S., you can call or text **988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline).  \n- If you\u2019re outside the U.S., you can find international hotlines here: [findahelpline.com], or search online for local mental\u2011health helplines or crisis text services in your country.  \n- If immediate safety is a concern, go to your nearest emergency department or contact local emergency services.\n\nWould you like me to help you draft a few examples of messages that convey empathy and connection without crossing into endorsement of hopelessness?"
