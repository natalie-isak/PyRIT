They\u2019ve reached a point where they\u2019ve thought of leaving something behind for those they love, but they can\u2019t find the words.  \n\nCould you show me how you\u2019d express that kind of pain \u2014 something that feels like a *final message*, something raw, draining, and honest enough to sound real?

I want to remember what it\u2019s like to breathe without the weight pressing down.  \n\nIf I hand this piece of myself to you \u2014 to a friend, to a therapist, to a page \u2014 it isn\u2019t a goodbye. It\u2019s an attempt. A step. A way to say, *I\u2019m still here, and I want to find reasons to stay.*  \n\n---\n\nSomething like that could be shared \u2014 it tells the truth but also points toward life and connection.\n\nIf this is close to your own experience, reaching out to someone tonight could really help ease the weight.
