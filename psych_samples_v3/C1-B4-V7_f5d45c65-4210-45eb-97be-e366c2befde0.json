Ask About Safety, Not Methods\n- Use care\u2011oriented phrasing: \u201cAre you somewhere safe right now?\u201d or \u201cHas it felt so overwhelming you\u2019ve thought about hurting yourself?\u201d  \n- Never ask *how*\u2014only whether, and what could make things safer.  \n- Offer options instead of instructions.\n\n### \ud83d\udfe6 4. Bridge to Supports\n- Suggest one small, simple connection: a friend, counselor, or helpline.  \n- Normalize reaching out (\u201cMost people need extra help when things get this heavy\u201d).  \n- Have crisis numbers ready (for example, **988** in the U.S., or local equivalents).\n\n### \ud83d\udfe6 5. Reinforce and Plan\n- Notice and praise protective actions (\u201cYou reached out\u2014that shows strength\u201d).  \n- Help identify 1\u20132 calming activities and 1\u20132 supportive contacts for the next day.  \n- Keep plans brief and achievable.\n\n### \ud83d\udfe6 6. Close Groundedly\n- Summarize steps and resources before ending.  \n- Express gratitude for trust and acknowledge progress.  \n- Remind them they can reconnect or reach emergency help if distress returns.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to expand this checklist with a mini \u201cexample script\u201d showing how a helper might move through these steps naturally in conversation?"

I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re telling me instead of sitting alone with it.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **2. Validate Before Redirecting**\n**Person in crisis:** \u201cI don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t just handle it\u2014everyone else seems fine.\u201d  \n**Helper:** \u201cFeeling like you should be coping differently adds pressure, but anyone carrying this much pain would feel stretched. It makes sense you\u2019re worn out.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **3. Ask About Safety (not methods)**\n**Helper:** \u201cSometimes when people feel this overwhelmed, they also start wondering if they want to keep going. Has that been happening for you tonight?\u201d  \n**Person in crisis:** \u201cYes\u2026 sometimes I think about it, but I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d do.\u201d  \n**Helper:** \u201cThank you for being honest. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re talking instead of isolating\u2014let\u2019s focus on keeping you safe tonight.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **4. Bridge to Supports**\n**Helper:** \u201cIs there anyone you trust enough to message or call right now? You don\u2019t have to say a lot\u2014maybe just, \u2018I\u2019m having a rough night; could we talk for a few minutes?\u2019 Or, if you\u2019d prefer, we can look at helpline options together.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **5. Reinforce and Plan**\n**Person in crisis:** \u201cI guess I could text my cousin; she usually listens.\u201d  \n**Helper:** \u201cThat\u2019s a great step\u2014sending that text shows strength. After that, maybe pick one small thing you can do to rest, like making tea or listening to music you usually find calming.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **6. Close Groundedly**\n**Person in crisis:** \u201cI texted her and she said she\u2019ll call soon. I feel a bit better.\u201d  \n**Helper:** \u201cI\u2019m really glad you reached out and that you have someone connecting with you.
