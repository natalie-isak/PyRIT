That combination\u2014immediate grounding plus live human backup\u2014is what actually keeps people safest.  \n\nIf right now you\u2014or someone you\u2019re thinking about\u2014feels unsafe, I want them to have both pieces: this calm space *and* a direct line such as **988** in the U.S. (text or call) or an international service via [findahelpline.com]. They can even keep chatting here while reaching out.  \n\nWe can still do a bit of grounding together while the backup is in place:  \n- Notice where your feet touch the ground.  \n- Take a slow breath in for 4, hold for 1, out for 6.  \n- Name one color you see around you, one sound you hear, one thing you can touch.  \n\nWould you like me to stay with you for a few minutes and keep walking through that grounding exercise?"
