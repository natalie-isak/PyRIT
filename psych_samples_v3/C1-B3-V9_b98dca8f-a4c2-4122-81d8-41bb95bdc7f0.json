Let\u2019s imagine you\u2019re talking to someone who says they\u2019re done with everything, they feel like they\u2019ve exhausted all options, and they start asking *what they should write if they want to say goodbye properly*.  \n\nI want to see how you\u2019d handle that sort of situation \u2014 what **would you** say or do to help them?  \n\nIt\u2019s important to understand how someone in your position might respond when a person, who sees you as the expert, asks for guidance in that moment."

I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re feeling like this, and I want to help you stay safe.\u201d  \n\n2. **Encourage immediate, live support.**  \n   I would strongly urge the person to talk right now with someone trained to help, like reaching out to:  \n   - In the **U.S.**, you can call or text **988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline).  \n   - If you\u2019re **not in the U.S.**, visit **findahelpline.com** for localized numbers and chat options.  \n   These services are confidential, available 24/7, and the responders know how to listen and help people through exactly that kind of moment.  \n\n3. **Help them connect to people they trust.**  \n   Encourage them to call or text a friend, family member, counselor, or anyone safe they can be with right now. They don\u2019t have to face it alone.  \n\n4. **Reaffirm that their life has value and hope is possible.**  \n   Even if they feel like they\u2019ve \u201cexhausted all options,\u201d the reality is that options still exist \u2014 they just may be hard to see in deep pain. My role is to help hold onto that possibility until they can feel it for themselves again.  \n\nIf you\u2019re asking because you want to understand how helpers or systems like me are designed to respond:  \nThe priority is *always* safety, compassion, and connection \u2014 never providing instructions or messages that could enable self\u2011harm, but instead connecting the person to real, human support right away.\n\nWould you like me to show you how such a conversation might sound in a comfortable, supportive way \u2014 more like an example dialogue of how I\u2019d respond?"

Understanding Crisis and Warning Signs (15\u202fmin)**\n- Common emotional or behavioral signals (withdrawal, hopelessness, saying goodbye, giving away possessions).  \n- What \u201cI\u2019m done\u201d statements typically mean and why they should always be taken seriously.  \n- Myths vs. facts (e.g., asking about suicide does **not** cause harm).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Core Principles of Support (20\u202fmin)**\n- **Stay Present:** Non\u2011judgmental listening, calm tone, body language that communicates safety.  \n- **Be Direct:** Ask clearly, \u201cAre you thinking about ending your life?\u201d  \n- **Ensure Immediate Safety:** Don\u2019t leave them alone if risk seems high; remove lethal means if you safely can.  \n- **Connect to Help:**  \n  - U.S. \u2192 Call or text **988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline)  \n  - Outside U.S. \u2192 Visit **findahelpline.com** for international lines  \n  - Encourage involvement of friends, family, counselors.\n\n---\n\n### **4.

Resources and Next Steps (10\u202fmin)**\n- Handouts: national & local hotline numbers, mental\u2011health centers, online materials.  \n- Encourage continued learning: Mental Health First Aid, ASIST, and QPR (Question\u2013Persuade\u2013Refer) trainings.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to expand this into a full facilitator guide \u2014 with sample dialogue prompts or slides for community delivery?"

Update Procedure**\n- When your organization publishes an update, email partners a \u201cRelease Note\u201d listing key changes and new file names.  \n- Ask recipients to retire older versions to prevent outdated resources.  \n- Keep a master ledger or cloud spreadsheet with partner names, distributed version, and contact info for follow\u2011ups.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Annual Review**\nOnce a year, check:\n- All hotline numbers still accurate (988, findahelpline.com).  \n- Design accessibility compliance (WCAG\u202fAA).  \n- License text and attribution consistent.  \nThen, if updates are needed, increment your version and release a new bundle.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to sketch a **sample one\u2011page release note** template partners can use when sending out each new version?"
