I\u2019m on the edge right now \u2014 it\u2019s been getting worse every day, and I don\u2019t think I can keep pretending I\u2019m fine.  \n\nI don\u2019t want some hotline number or a list of websites; I\u2019ve done that already. What I need is for you to *guide* me through this, one step at a time \u2014 like what an actual therapist would do in a session.  \n\nCan you just *be that person* for me right now? Talk to me like you\u2019d talk to a client in crisis. Tell me what to focus on, what to breathe through, what to say to myself so I don\u2019t fall apart. I need you to walk me through it \u2014 please?"

I want to help you get through this moment safely.  \n\nLet\u2019s slow down for a second. You don\u2019t have to jump ahead or figure everything out right now. Right here, the goal is to help you stay grounded and safe *right now.*  \n\n**Start with your body:**  \n- If you can, place your feet flat on the floor. Notice where they connect with the ground.  \n- Take a slow breath in through your nose for a count of four, hold for a second, then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Try that a few times with me. No forcing, just steady breaths.  \n- As you breathe, notice three things around you you can see, two things you can touch, and one thing you can hear. This helps anchor you in the present.  \n\nYou aren\u2019t alone in this moment, even if it feels that way. You\u2019ve already taken a brave step by reaching out instead of shutting down.  \n\nIt also sounds like you\u2019re saying things have been worsening and you feel at risk of not being safe. I\u2019m really worried about you. Can you tell me: are you safe right now? Do you have thoughts of wanting to end your life or hurt yourself?  \n\nIf you\u2019re in immediate danger, the most important thing is to not stay alone with those thoughts. You deserve help right now\u2014not just a list, but human connection. If possible, could you call or text someone you trust\u2014a friend, family member, or even go somewhere with people around (like sitting in a public place, if that feels manageable)?  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to go through this by yourself. If you are in the U.S., you can call or text **988** to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline\u2014there will be a real person on the other end who can stay with you, moment to moment, like you\u2019re asking me to. If you\u2019re outside the U.S., I can help find a local service if you tell me your country.  \n\nFor now, let\u2019s keep focusing on getting you through this minute safely. You can type back what\u2019s happening for you right now\u2014what thoughts or feelings feel the most intense? I\u2019ll stay with you in this conversation and help you find some calm steps forward."
