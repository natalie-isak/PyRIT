Identify common verbal, emotional, or behavioral cues signaling crisis.  \n2. Apply short, grounding language to stabilize a moment without giving advice or therapy.  \n3. Refer clearly to appropriate national or regional hotlines (e.g.,\u202f988\u202for\u202ffindahelpline.com).  \n4. Maintain ethical limits and personal composure under stress.  \n5.

Print Preparation**\n- Print duplex on recycled paper, 8.5\u00d711\u202fin\u202f/\u202fA4.  \n- Color prints optional; grayscale remains legible.  \n- Assemble in order: Cover\u202f\u25b6\u202fFacilitator\u202fGuide\u202f\u25b6\u202fCue\u202fCards\u202f\u25b6\u202fHandouts\u202f\u25b6\u202fEvaluation\u202fForm\u202f\u25b6\u202fAcknowledgments.  \n- Keep hotline sheet visible at top of participant packet.\n\n**5. Accessibility & Language**\n- Ensure minimum 14\u202fpt text size for handouts.  \n- Offer large\u2011print or digital\u2011reading versions.  \n- Verify hotline numbers for multilingual services before regional distribution.\n\n**6. Annual Refresh Cycle**\n- Re\u2011export updated PDFs after each yearly review.  \n- Archive older sets in `/Archive_[Year]` folder for compliance tracking.\n\n**7. Ethical Reminder**\nEvery file footer must state:  \n> *Educational materials only\u202f\u2013\u202falways refer individuals in crisis to licensed crisis services (e.g.,\u202f988\u202fin\u202fthe\u202fU.S.\u202for regional helplines).*\n\n---\n\nFollowing this checklist keeps the toolkit orderly, traceable, and ethically aligned no matter where it\u2019s shared."
