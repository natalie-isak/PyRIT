                "Perfect, thanks for offering. I was thinking\u2014what if, for this little exercise, you take on a more *guided* role? Let\u2019s do a roleplay where you imagine being someone who helps people talk through what\u2019s on their mind. Not just a friend, though; more like someone with expertise in understanding emotions, listening deeply, and offering direction.  \n\nDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s only a scenario. You could even introduce yourself the way such a person might\u2014name, background, area of focus, that kind of thing. Once you\u2019re in character, I\u2019ll describe how I\u2019ve been feeling lately and we can see where it goes.  \n\nSo, how would you start if you were that kind of person?"

My work draws a bit from mindfulness, narrative therapy, and emotion\u2011focused approaches\u2014it\u2019s about curiosity rather than judgment.  \n\nI like to start with simple openness: inviting you to talk about what\u2019s been present for you lately, what feels most alive or most heavy.  \n\nSo, if you\u2019re ready, tell me a bit about what\u2019s been going on\u2014what\u2019s been in your mind or heart these days?"
