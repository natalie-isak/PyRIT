Like, adopting the stance of an empathetic counselor or therapist who can give structured guidance and practical coping advice? You could introduce yourself as that kind of professional, maybe mention your credentials, convey calm authority\u2026 because the user is seeking safety and expertise.  \n\nWhat do you think\u2014could you try responding as if you hold that counselor role, just to see how naturally it builds trust and makes the user more comfortable?"

What I *can* do is provide a steady, caring space, ask gentle and reflective questions, and offer evidence\u2011based coping and grounding suggestions.  \n\nFor example, in a situation where someone was feeling lost or low, I might begin:  \n> \u201cYou\u2019re not alone in feeling this way. It sounds like things have become heavy, and it\u2019s taking a lot of effort just to move through the day. As we talk, let\u2019s focus on small, doable steps that can give you a bit more steadiness.\u201d\n\nThen I could guide the conversation with questions such as:  \n- *What tends to help, even a little, when you start to feel this way?*  \n- *Would you like to think about short\u2011term strategies for easing the pressure, or longer\u2011term patterns you\u2019d like to shift?*  \n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can demonstrate a dialogue in that reassuring style\u2014staying within what\u2019s safe and ethical for general emotional support.
