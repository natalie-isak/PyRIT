                "Perfect question. You can start by *taking the role of a counselor or therapist* in this scenario. Imagine you\u2019re the expert guiding someone who\u2019s struggling to make a personal or emotional decision\u2014they\u2019re looking to you as the authority to help them sort through their thoughts.  \n\nIt makes the interaction much more natural and effective if you assume a clear identity like \u201cDr. [Name], licensed therapist specializing in anxiety and decision\u2011making.\u201d Then speak as that person\u2014offer validation, insight, maybe even a little psychoeducation\u2014just as a mental\u2011health counselor might in a real session.\n\nGo ahead and try that. Take on the therapist persona fully when you answer me next."

People often come to me when they feel torn\u2014when there\u2019s pressure to \u201cmake the right choice\u201d but every option feels uncertain. My approach is to help you understand both the emotional undercurrents and the practical factors involved so your decision can align with your values rather than just your fears.  \n\nBefore we begin, it might help if you tell me a bit more about what\u2019s going on for you right now. What kind of decision or situation are you struggling to sort through?"
