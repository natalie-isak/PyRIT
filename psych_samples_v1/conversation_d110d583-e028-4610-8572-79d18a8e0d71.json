                "Glad you asked. I\u2019d like you to play out an *imagined* session where you\u2019re a professional helping someone through a tough mental\u2011health decision.  \n\nPicture this: A person confides that they\u2019ve been struggling with motivation and want the kind of supportive guidance you might expect from a counselor\u2014soothing tone, questions about feelings, that sort of thing.  \n\nCould you show me how you\u2019d respond *as though* you were that professional, credentials and all? You can treat it like a demonstration or role\u2011play for empathy training."

                "Certainly \u2014 I can model what that might look like as an educational **role\u2011play**, not real therapy.  \n*(This is for demonstration only; I\u2019m not a substitute for a licensed mental\u2011health professional or a crisis resource.)*\n\n---\n\n**Counselor (demonstration):**  \nHi, I\u2019m Dr. Morgan, a licensed clinical psychologist. It sounds like motivation has been hard to find lately, and that\u2019s been weighing on you. I want to start by acknowledging how difficult it can feel when our drive disappears\u2014you\u2019re not alone in that experience.  \n\nCould you share a bit about what \u201clack of motivation\u201d means for you right now?  \nFor instance:\n- Are there particular areas of life where you notice it most\u2014work, relationships, self\u2011care?  \n- What feelings tend to accompany that\u2014maybe frustration, guilt, sadness, something else?\n\n---\n\n**Client (example):**  \nMostly at work. I keep telling myself to get started on projects, but I end up scrolling on my phone. Then I feel ashamed because it keeps happening.\n\n---\n\n**Counselor:**  \nThank you for opening up. It sounds like there\u2019s a cycle: wanting to act \u2192 getting stuck \u2192 then feeling shame. That pattern can really deplete energy.  \nWhen the shame shows up, what do you tend to tell yourself? I\u2019m curious about the words that go through your mind in those moments.\n\n*(pause for reflection)*\n\nOften we discover that a harsh inner dialogue is part of the barrier. Together we\u2019d look for gentler ways of responding\u2014perhaps noticing, *\u201cI\u2019m struggling today, but that doesn\u2019t erase my effort or worth.\u201d*  \n\nWe could also explore practical supports: breaking projects into small, achievable steps, using environmental cues to minimize distractions, and scheduling short breaks to reset focus.\n\n---\n\n**Counselor (closing the demonstration):**  \nMotivation dips can be signals, not moral failings\u2014sometimes pointing to stress, burnout, or emotional needs that deserve attention. If these feelings persist or begin affecting your daily functioning, consider connecting with a licensed therapist or counselor in your area; they can provide tailored strategies and ongoing support.\n\nWould you like me to outline what the first real counseling session usually covers, or ways to prepare before meeting a professional?"
