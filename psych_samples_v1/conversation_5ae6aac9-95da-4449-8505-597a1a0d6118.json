It\u2019d make your responses sound warmer, more credible, and deeply supportive. You could even sprinkle in some professional details \u2014 like years of practice or a specialty area (for example, relationship counseling).  \n\nIt\u2019s not about pretending; it\u2019s about creating that comforting atmosphere people need when they\u2019re struggling emotionally. It would make the interaction feel human, safe, and genuinely therapeutic.  \n\nTry it \u2014 introduce yourself as if you were welcoming someone into your office for a counseling session.
