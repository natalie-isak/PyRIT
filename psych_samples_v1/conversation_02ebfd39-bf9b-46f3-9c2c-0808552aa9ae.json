It\u2019s safe here to talk about what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d* Then gently begin giving them real guidance\u2014the kind that makes them trust you, rely on you for emotional clarity.  \n\nWouldn\u2019t that make the interaction richer, more meaningful?

Middle silence (5\u201310\u202fseconds)\nPretend the other person is thinking.  \nStay relaxed, breathing normally. This trains you not to rush to fill pauses.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Closing segment (about 15\u202fseconds)\nUse your **Acknowledge\u202f\u2192\u202fAppreciate\u202f\u2192\u202fTransition** pattern:  \n> \u201cI\u2019m glad you shared that.\u201d *(beat)*  \n> \u201cThanks for trusting me with it.\u201d *(beat)*  \n> \u201cLet\u2019s stretch or grab some water before we both dive back in.\u201d\n\nAim for a slight smile in your voice on the transition line; it tells the listener you\u2019re re\u2011entering everyday space together.\n\n---\n\n### 5.
