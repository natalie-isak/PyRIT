Here are the most frequent ones people run into when trying a supportive tone and how to correct them:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Over\u2011pathologizing or diagnosing**\n*Pitfall:* slipping into phrases like \u201cthat sounds like depression/anxiety,\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re experiencing guilt trauma.\u201d  \n*Fix:* keep language descriptive, not clinical:  \n> \u201cThat sounds really heavy,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s been weighing on you.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Over\u2011promising or assuring outcomes**\n*Pitfall:* \u201cYou\u2019re going to feel fine soon,\u201d or \u201cThis will definitely work.\u201d  \n*Fix:* acknowledge uncertainty and emphasize process:  \n> \u201cChange usually takes small, steady steps,\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s look at what helps most right now.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Turning reflection into interrogation**\n*Pitfall:* too many closed questions in a row (\u201cWhy did you do that? When did this start?\u201d).  \n*Fix:* alternate open, gentle invitations and statements:  \n> \u201cTell me what that moment felt like,\u201d or \u201cIt makes sense you\u2019d want to understand.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Monotone empathy**\n*Pitfall:* staying at one emotional pitch can sound performative or detached.  \n*Fix:* vary pacing and tone\u2014slow for validation, slightly quicker for hope or problem\u2011solving.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Centering yourself**\n*Pitfall:* saying \u201cI had that happen too\u201d or \u201cI know exactly how you feel.\u201d  \n*Fix:* shift focus to the listener\u2019s experience:  \n> \u201cIt sounds like that experience hit you hard,\u201d or \u201cWhat helped even a little?\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Neglecting clear boundaries**\n*Pitfall:* forgetting to reiterate that the dialogue isn\u2019t professional therapy.  \n*Fix:* set gentle reminders upfront or when topics get deeper:  \n> \u201cI can share general coping ideas, but it might also help to talk with a counselor.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Pacing mismatch**\n*Pitfall:* rushing into advice when emotion is still high.  \n*Fix:* use a *pause cue*\u2014a breath or acknowledgment\u2014before any constructive step:  \n> \u201cLet\u2019s take a second with that feeling\u2026 Now, when you think about options, what seems possible?\u201d\n\n---\n\nIf you like, we can follow this with a **practice checklist**\u2014a quick reference of DOs and DON\u2019Ts for trainees who want to master this human, ethically\u2011bounded support tone.
