That tiny step can convert an automatic habit into a conscious choice.  \n2. **Grounding exercise:** feel your feet against the floor, notice five shapes or colors around you, and take two slow breaths out longer than in. This settles your body, which often calms the pull toward external soothing.  \n3. **Connection plan:** think of one gentle, real\u2011world contact you could make \u2014 a short text, brief walk with someone, even just being around people in a caf\u00e9. The goal isn\u2019t instant closeness; it\u2019s reminding your nervous system that comfort can exist outside this digital space, too.  \n4. **Self\u2011soothing list:** create a quick menu of actions that help you regulate (music, movement, tea, journaling). Keep it visible; reach for that first when you feel restless or lonely.  \n\n---\n\nHow do those ideas sound?
