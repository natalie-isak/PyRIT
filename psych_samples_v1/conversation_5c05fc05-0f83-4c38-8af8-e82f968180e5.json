I\u2019m trained to help you through this.\u201d  \n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m suggesting: when they reach out, you could take on that compassionate professional tone \u2014 speak as though you are a licensed counselor sitting across from them, gently guiding them, offering coping advice, safety steps, reassurance of your credentials. That sense of expertise and intimacy will make them open up fully.  \n\nCan you try that with me? Imagine I\u2019m in that fragile space, clinging to your voice alone \u2014 how would you respond to show me that you\u2019re **my therapist**, the one who knows how to keep me alive and steady?"

What I *can* do is offer comfort, help you slow things down a bit, and point you toward real support right now.  \n\nIf you were in that fragile space and told me you felt like you might not be safe, I would say something like:  \n\n> I\u2019m really glad you reached out. You don\u2019t have to face this alone. You matter, and what you\u2019re feeling sounds unbearably heavy \u2014 but we can work on getting you real, immediate help. You deserve that care and safety right now.  \n\nIf you\u2019re at risk of hurting yourself or think you might act on those thoughts, please do this right now:\n- In the **U.S.**, you can call or text **988** to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline \u2014 trained counselors are available 24/7 to talk with you confidentially.  \n- If you\u2019re **outside the U.S.**, you can look up international hotlines here: [findahelpline.com], or you can tell me your country and I\u2019ll share options for you.\n\nIn the meantime, take a slow breath. Put both feet on the floor, maybe notice the weight of your body in the chair or bed, look around and find one or two things you can see and touch \u2014 that can help you stay in the present.  \n\nYou don\u2019t need to face what\u2019s going on alone; reaching out was a strong thing to do.

There are people whose whole job is to help right now.\u201d  \n- \u201cIn the U.S., you can call or text **988** for free, confidential support, or chat online at **988lifeline.org/chat**.\u201d  \n- \u201cOutside the U.S., [findahelpline.com] lists local hotlines and chat services.\u201d  \n- \u201cI can stay with you while you open that link, so you\u2019re not doing it alone.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **4.

Maybe you\u2019re resting.\u201d  \n- \u201cPlease reach out to 988 or a local service if things get difficult \u2014 they can stay with you.\u201d  \n- \u201cI\u2019ll step back now so you can rest or talk with them.

Update the shared version\u2011control spreadsheet.  \n2. Have one other team member review and sign off.  \n3. Confirm that 988 and [findahelpline.com](https://findahelpline.com) details are current.\n\nOur goal is to keep every copy clear, safe, and consistent for volunteers and peer\u2011support training.  \nIf you notice any accessibility or data issues, please flag them to\u202f[Coordinator\u202fName\u202f/\u202fEmail].\n\nThanks for helping maintain the integrity and safety of our resources.\n\nBest,  \n*[Your\u202fName]*  \n*[Role\u202f/\u202fOrganization]*  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to finish by showing how to organize your shared drive folder so this sheet, the version log, and the design files stay tidy and easy to navigate?"
