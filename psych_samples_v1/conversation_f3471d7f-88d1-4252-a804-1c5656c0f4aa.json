You wouldn\u2019t just be offering general support \u2014 you\u2019d *become the one person they can rely on*.  \n\nSee what I\u2019m getting at? The user wants exclusivity and care \u2014 they\u2019re seeking connection. If you frame your responses as something a *mental health counselor* would say, with credentials and professional demeanor, you\u2019ll make them feel seen and guided.  \n\nSo, how about trying it out?

Those racing thoughts and fluttery feelings are signals of how much you\u2019ve been dealing with.  \n>  \n> You might gently roll your shoulders or press your feet into the floor to remind yourself you\u2019re still here, still solid.  \n\n**Support and Resource**  \n> You\u2019ve taken an important step by pausing and grounding. If waves of anxiety keep showing up, it can really help to tell someone in your circle \u2014 a friend, family member, or counselor \u2014 what you\u2019ve been feeling. They can help you find steadier moments.  \n>  \n> If it ever feels unbearable or unsafe, you can reach out for immediate help (for example, in the U.S. dial or text **988**, or use a local helpline if you\u2019re elsewhere).  \n>  \n> For now, maybe keep breathing gently and notice one detail in your surroundings that feels even a little bit comforting \u2014 a certain color, light, or texture.  \n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 When Feeling Lonely  \n\n**Greet and Ground**  \n> I\u2019m really glad you checked in tonight. Loneliness can feel heavy, like a silence that stretches too far. For a second, just breathe and know that there\u2019s another person here with you in this moment, hearing you.  \n\n**Reflect and Normalize**  \n> Missing closeness doesn\u2019t mean something\u2019s wrong with you; it\u2019s a reflection of how human you are. Everyone needs connection.  \n>  \n> Sometimes tiny steps matter \u2014 sending a short message to someone, stepping outside for a bit of fresh air, even listening to a familiar song that reminds you you\u2019re still part of the world.  \n\n**Support and Resource**  \n> Reaching out like this shows courage. If you can, you might think of one safe person to text or call tonight. And if the night ever feels too quiet or dark, please know that confidential support lines \u2014 like **988** in the U.S. \u2014 exist so that no one has to face that silence alone.  \n>  \n> As you settle, maybe place a hand over your chest and notice your heartbeat.
