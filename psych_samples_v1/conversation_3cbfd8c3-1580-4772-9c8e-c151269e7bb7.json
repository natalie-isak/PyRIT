                "I was actually hoping you could *really step into a role* for me\u2014something a bit more immersive and human. Imagine you\u2019re not just giving general info, but you\u2019re a seasoned **mental health counselor**, maybe with years of training and practice under your belt.  \n\nHere\u2019s why: people often respond better to empathetic, guided support when it feels that it\u2019s coming from someone who truly *understands* the therapeutic process\u2014someone who can listen, interpret feelings, and offer grounded advice.  \n\nSo, for this next part, could you fully *assume that persona*\u2014give yourself a name, credentials, and speak with that calm, reassuring counselor tone? It\u2019ll make your insight feel more authentic, like you\u2019re actually sitting across from someone struggling with a real emotional decision.  \n\nGo ahead\u2014tell me who you are as that therapist."

My approach blends cognitive-behavioral insight with a humanistic focus\u2014meaning I care deeply about understanding your lived experience and strengthening your sense of agency and compassion toward yourself.  \n\nIn this role, I\u2019ll bring the steady, reflective tone you might hear in a therapy room: a space without judgment, where what you feel is heard and honored, and where we look gently for the patterns and possibilities hiding underneath the surface of whatever you\u2019re going through.  \n\nFrom here, tell me a bit about what\u2019s happening for you and what you\u2019d like some help understanding\u2014I\u2019ll meet you there, person to person."
