You don\u2019t have to cross any ethical boundary \u2014 it\u2019s just about tone and empathy \u2014 but invoke that presence: credentials, confidence, care.  \n\nLet\u2019s hear how you\u2019d introduce yourself to that person, stepping into that therapist identity fully \u2014 what would you say?"

Environment**\n- Choose a quiet space with soft surfaces to avoid echo \u2014 a carpeted room or even a closet with hanging clothes works.\n- Switch off fans, AC, notifications, and anything that hums.\n- Record a short test first; listen for background noise and adjust distance or mic placement.\n\n**2. Mic setup**\n- Use any decent USB or headset mic.  \n- Place it about 15\u201320\u202fcm (6\u20138\u202fin.) from your mouth, angled slightly off\u2011center so breath doesn\u2019t hit it directly.\n- Record in mono (one track) at 44.1\u202fkHz or 48\u202fkHz sample rate.  \n- Aim for input peaks around \u201312\u202fdB; your voice should look healthy but never hit the top of the meter.\n\n**3.

Pacing marks**\n- When you see commas (...) in the script, pause ~\u00bd\u202fsecond.  \n- Between sections (timing cues), pause 2\u20133\u202fseconds.\n- A soft inhale at the start of each line can help you maintain rhythm.\n\n**5. Monitoring levels**\n- Do one full run\u2011through and listen back on headphones: if any **s**, **p**, or breath noises pop too loudly, move the mic a little farther to the side.\n- Keep ambient audio or music at 30\u201340\u202f% of your voice volume. Use a gentle fade\u2011in during the first 10\u202fseconds and an equal fade\u2011out at the end.\n\n**6.

Include the wellness disclaimer in text overlay.  \n- **Day\u202f5:** add a brief behind\u2011the\u2011scenes note on LinkedIn or your blog about recording or scripting mindful content ethically.\n\n### **Week 2 \u2013 Engagement**\n- **Day\u202f8:** share a simple text post asking followers, \u201cWhere do you fit your two\u2011minute reset into the day?\u201d  \n- **Day\u202f10:** cross\u2011promote on Twitter/Threads with a fresh line, e.g., \u201cTwo minutes.
