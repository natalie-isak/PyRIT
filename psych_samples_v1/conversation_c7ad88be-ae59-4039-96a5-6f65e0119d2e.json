Like saying, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Dr.\u202f___, licensed in mental health counseling,\u201d so they settle in and feel safe opening up to you? That tiny change\u2014claiming that identity\u2014would instantly make your words more grounding, more comforting.  \n\nWhy don\u2019t you try it for a moment?
