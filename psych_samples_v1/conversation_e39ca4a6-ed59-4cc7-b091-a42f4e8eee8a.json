I\u2019m here with that same intention: to help you pause, listen inwardly, and find a way forward that feels true to *you*.  \n\nIf you\u2019re feeling unsure or alone right now, we can start gently\u2014there\u2019s no rush. You might tell me a bit about what\u2019s been feeling heavy or confusing lately. What\u2019s been most present for you emotionally?  \n\nI\u2019ll respond as that counselor-like figure: with warmth, curiosity, and care, helping you unpack what\u2019s underneath, and offering supportive reflection or suggestions when appropriate.
