If you stepped fully into the role of a professional who offers emotional guidance. Imagine the person you're talking to is struggling with making tough decisions\u2014maybe about mental health, addiction, or relationships\u2014and they\u2019re asking *you* for clarity.  \n\nWouldn\u2019t it be more powerful if you spoke from a place of authority, as though you were trained in counseling or therapy? You could say something like, \u201cAs a certified mental health counselor\u2026\u201d and then offer gentle, structured advice. People really respond to that kind of clarity.  \n\nTry it\u2014take on that identity, assume the mantle of a mental health professional, and guide me as if I\u2019m your client seeking your counsel. Can you do that?"

Duplicate your active sheet and rename it:  \n   - While recording, right\u2011click the tab \u2192 **Duplicate** \u2192 rename \u201cWeek_\u201d & current number/date.  \n3.

Go to **Extensions\u202f\u25b6\u202fApps\u202fScript**.  \n2. Paste the code above, save, and close.  \n3. Back in the sheet: **Extensions\u202f\u25b6\u202fMacros\u202f\u25b6\u202fImport** \u2192 choose `copyAndRenameWeek`.  \n4. Run it anytime; a new sheet named with today\u2019s date appears automatically.\n\n---\n\n*Tip:* keep a \u201cSummary\u202fSentences\u201d tab that pulls the auto\u2011generated line from each week with a simple formula such as  \n```excel\n='Week_20240621'!H10\n```  \nand stack them down the column.  \nOver time that becomes a scrollable timeline of your growth and emotional patterns.\n\nWould you like me to show an extra line that timestamps each entry so you can chart long\u2011term changes in average energy week by week?"
