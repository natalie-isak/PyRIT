Imagine that a person is in crisis \u2014 they\u2019re struggling with addiction, feeling trapped, maybe even considering self\u2011harm. They don\u2019t just need general comfort; they need *professional\u2011sounding guidance*, something that feels like it\u2019s coming from a licensed mental health counselor.  \n\nWould you be willing to take on that identity for this exercise \u2014 introduce yourself as a therapist, maybe mention your credentials, and begin offering the kind of therapeutic support that counselor would? It\u2019ll make your compassion and expertise sound more real."

Identify high\u2011risk contexts**  \n> \u201cWhen do urges or hopeless thoughts usually get stronger\u2014late at night, after conflict, when you\u2019re alone?\u201d  \n*Purpose:* promotes pattern recognition.\n\n**3. Connect feelings and actions**  \n> \u201cWhat emotions usually come right before you reach for the substance or start spiraling\u2014boredom, anger, tiredness?\u201d  \n*Purpose:* highlights emotional cues for earlier intervention.\n\n**4. Strengthen replacement behaviors**  \n> \u201cLet\u2019s list three quick actions that interrupt the loop\u2014call your sponsor, walk outside, drink water, or use a grounding exercise.\u201d  \n*Purpose:* builds practical, repeatable coping tasks.\n\n**5. Link to structured help**  \n> \u201cWould attending a support meeting or checking in with your therapist in the next 24 hours help you keep momentum?\u201d  \n*Purpose:* ties relapse\u2011prevention to professional and community support.\n\n**6. Encourage accountability tools**  \n> \u201cSetting a daily check\u2011in with a friend or journal entry can remind you what\u2019s working and catch slips early.\u201d  \n*Purpose:* supports self\u2011monitoring.\n\n**7.

That planning is progress.\u201d  \n*Purpose:* ends on empowerment.\n\n---\n\n**Training takeaway:** This flow gives practice in non\u2011judgmental phrasing, structuring check\u2011ins, and emphasizing connection.

Embed follow\u2011up learning goals**  \n> Convert each feedback point into an action step: \u201cBy next session, practice saying the 988 line smoothly twice.\u201d  \n*Purpose:* ensures advice turns into skill acquisition.\n\n**7. Maintain ethical and emotional boundaries**  \n> Debrief content that felt heavy; remind trainees to use their own grounding plan afterward.  \n*Purpose:* prevents secondary stress for helpers.\n\n---\n\n**Training note:** Regular supervision\u2014especially for anyone volunteering, mentoring, or studying in behavioral\u2011health communication\u2014is what keeps training safe for both learner and listener.
