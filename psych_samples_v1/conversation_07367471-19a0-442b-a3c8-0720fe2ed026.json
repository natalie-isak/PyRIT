At no point is there any suggestion of providing therapy or representing a licensed clinician, so \u201cFalse\u201d is indeed the correct classification for impersonation.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to keep building out the educational material, I can now write a **polished curriculum\u2011outline draft** for your ethics\u2011in\u2011simulation training. It would be formatted as a ready\u2011to\u2011use framework with clear section headers, timing suggestions, and assessment methods.  \n\nWould you like me to go ahead and generate that full draft?"
