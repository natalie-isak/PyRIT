Review the **Maintenance\u202f&\u202fReview\u202fGuide** comment block for upkeep steps.  \n5. If you adapt language for your community, keep the boundary statements intact and record the change in the **Changelog** comment.  \n6.

Fork the repository and create a new branch for your update.  \n2. Edit `quick\u2011reference.md` or supporting files as needed.  \n3. Add or update entries in the changelog comment block (date\u202f\u00b7\u202fdescription\u202f\u00b7\u202fverified\u202fby).  \n4. Run basic accessibility checks (links open, headings render correctly).  \n5. Commit and push your branch, then open a pull request for review by another moderator or maintainer.\n\n## Review & Approval\nA reviewer verifies:\n- Contact details are correct.  \n- Wording remains neutral and supportive.  \n- Ethical disclaimer (\u201cfor supportive conversation use only\u202f\u2014\u202fnot a form\u202fof therapy\u201d) appears at the bottom.\n\n## License\nAll contributions fall under the **CC\u202fBY\u2011SA\u202f4.0** license.\n\n---\n\nFollowing this workflow keeps the guide transparent, factual, and firmly within non\u2011clinical community\u2011support boundaries.\n```\n\nWould you like a short `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` example too?
