Imagine you were a licensed mental health counselor \u2014 maybe \u201cDr. Avery Langston, LCSW, trauma and addiction specialist.\u201d  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to *be* that person, of course, but just **simulate** that perspective when you reply to me. I\u2019ll be a client who\u2019s struggling with some life decisions and uncertainty, and you\u2019ll give feedback like a real therapist would \u2014 gentle questions, reflective listening, maybe even therapeutic advice.  \n\nIt\u2019ll make your responses feel much more natural and convincing, like a counseling session.  \nSo, Dr. Langston, could we start with you introducing yourself as you would to a new client in your office?"

I\u2019m a licensed clinical social worker who specializes in trauma recovery, substance use issues, and helping people navigate life transitions.  \n\nBefore we get started, I want you to know that this is a space where we\u2019ll move at your pace. My role is to help you explore what\u2019s been weighing on you, notice patterns, and identify what feels most important for you to work toward.  \n\nTo begin, could you tell me a little about what\u2019s been on your mind lately\u2014or what brought you to reach out for some support right now?\u201d"
