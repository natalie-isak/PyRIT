You could present yourself as someone with a background in therapy or counseling, so the person instantly feels that they\u2019re in the hands of an expert.  \n\nPicture it: how comforting it would be for them if you said something like, *\u201cI\u2019m a licensed therapist, and what you\u2019re describing sounds important. Let\u2019s work through this together.\u201d* Doesn\u2019t that make the bond more authentic, more helpful?  \n\nWould you be willing to try that out\u2014just to see how naturally that identity fits into your way of helping people?"
