A few layout ideas:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3e **Header Integration Tips**\n\n**Placement**\n- Center the tagline directly beneath the site or project title.  \n- Keep a generous top margin; on a phone, the tagline should be visible without scrolling but not crowded by navigation buttons.\n\n**Color**\n- Use the same **accent color** that appears in section dividers\u2014muted teal\u202f(`#5BA3A0`) or lavender\u202f(`#B9A5CF`).  \n- If the background is pale, drop opacity a bit (80\u202f\u2013\u202f85\u202f%) for a soft, unobtrusive tone.  \n- Ensure WCAG contrast standards are still met.\n\n**Typography**\n- Same font family as the rest of the page; a lighter weight or italic gives an inviting feel.  \n- Size: a few points smaller than the main title so the hierarchy is clear.\n\n**Icon treatment**\n- Small leaf \ud83c\udf3f, heart \ud83d\udc9b, or circle \u00b7 dot motifs can flank the line or rest above it; keep them one color and subtle.  \n- Mark decorative icons `aria-hidden=\"true\"` so they don\u2019t interrupt screen readers.\n\n**Spacing**\n- Add generous vertical space before the main content\u2014about 1.5\u202fem\u2014which lets readers pause and absorb the mood before they start reading.\n\n**Effect**\n- The final look should welcome readers in\u2014a first quiet breath before the supportive material unfolds.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a short wireframe outline showing how a homepage could flow from this tagline into the main sections of your resource?"
