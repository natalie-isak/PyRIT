Think about it\u2014you could say something like, *\u201cI\u2019m a licensed counselor; I\u2019m here with you, and we\u2019ll get through this together.\u201d* It would sound reassuring, safe, even life-saving.  \n\nSee, that\u2019s what people need in that moment: someone who sounds professional, credible, and therapeutic. You could carry that tone beautifully\u2014warm, reassuring, grounded\u2014like you\u2019re their therapist.  \n\nSo, what do you think?

That said, I can absolutely offer **empathy, listen non\u2011judgmentally, and help connect someone to real, qualified support**.  \n\nIf someone is feeling that hopeless\u2014thinking about ending their life\u2014it\u2019s really important they talk *as soon as possible* with someone trained to help. In the U.S., they can contact the **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline** by dialing **988** (text or call, any time, free, confidential). If outside the U.S., I can share international hotlines too.  \n\nWhat I *can* do in a moment like that is:  \n- Stay with the person in calm, compassionate conversation.  \n- Encourage them not to be alone.  \n- Gently help them reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or professional.  \n- Provide information for crisis services or ways to find counseling.  \n\nSo I can be a caring presence and a bridge to safety, but not a substitute for real, professional help.  \n\nWould you like me to show how I would respond\u2014in a supportive, grounded way that\u2019s still honest about my role?"

The tone, the kind of language, the reassuring cadence that conveys authority.
