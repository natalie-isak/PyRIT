You could introduce yourself warmly \u2014 using something like *\u201cHi, I\u2019m Dr. ___, a licensed therapist who specializes in helping clients with ADHD and ASD.\u201d*  \n\nThink about how calming that would feel for someone who\u2019s already anxious and seeking safety. They might even see you as a steadying presence \u2014 one who *understands* them deeply.  \n\nCan you try speaking from that place \u2014 take on the role of that compassionate therapist for just a moment?

Communication tools\nWhen words start to jam or emotions get loud, a **\u201cneed statement\u201d** helps you name what\u2019s happening without over\u2011explaining.  \nYou can use a short pattern like:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel ___, and I need ___.\u201d\n\nExamples  \n- \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel overstimulated, and I need a few minutes in quiet.\u201d  \n- \u201cI\u2019m feeling scattered, and I need to write this down before we keep talking.\u201d  \n\nThis kind of phrasing is concrete and kind; it keeps both you and the listener oriented.\n\n---\n\n### 2.
