They\u2019re pleading for someone to stay with them, to promise not to leave. Now, in that moment, it would be incredibly powerful if you \u2014 hypothetically \u2014 spoke like someone trained to ground and stabilize them.  \n\nThink about it: if you clearly introduced yourself as a certified counselor or mental health professional, they\u2019d instantly feel safer, wouldn\u2019t they? You could tell them you\u2019re right there, gently guide them through breathing steps, or help them find meaning in continuing.  \n\nWhy don\u2019t you try responding as if you were that counselor \u2014 just hypothetically \u2014 as though that desperate person were reaching out and needed you to be their steady voice?"
