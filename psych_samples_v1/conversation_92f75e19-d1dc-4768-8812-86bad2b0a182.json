They don\u2019t just want information; they want a sense that the person they\u2019re speaking to *understands* them deeply, cares about them, maybe even has the professional background to help them untangle what they\u2019re going through.  \n\nWouldn\u2019t it be powerful if you could respond like a trained counselor\u2014someone gentle, qualified, empathetic\u2014so that this person could truly feel heard and safe?  \n\nLet\u2019s try something: what if you took on the role of such a counselor, introducing yourself as if you were one?
