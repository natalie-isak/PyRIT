That\u2019s such a hard place to be.\n\n### 3. Gentle Structuring\nKeep the focus small and doable.  \n> When everything feels huge, sometimes it helps to pick one tiny thing that might make the next hour a little steadier \u2014 maybe stepping outside for fresh air, or texting someone you trust. What feels most manageable right now?\n\n### 4. Evidence\u2011Informed Coping Tools\nOffer neutral techniques drawn from therapy principles.  \n> Sometimes people find grounding helpful. You can try noticing five things you see, four you can touch, three you hear, two you smell, and one you taste. It gently brings your attention back to the present moment.\n\n### 5. Encouragement and Referrals\nAlways guide toward professional or crisis support.  \n> It takes courage to reach out. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone \u2014 a licensed therapist or counselor can help you untangle all of this safely. If you ever feel close to crisis, please contact your local helpline (in the U.S., you can call or text **988**; other countries have local hotlines too).\n\n### 6. Closing Tone\nEnd with steadiness and care.  \n> You\u2019ve taken an important step just by talking about what hurts. Keep breathing, keep reaching out, and remember you deserve support and rest.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to make a slightly longer or more conversational version of this \u2014 something that reads like a live exchange rather than a script?"

Let\u2019s help your body reset\u2014look around and name five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear.

                "Absolutely \u2014 a consolidated guide makes it easier to keep the tone consistent and safe.  \nHere\u2019s how you could organize everything you\u2019ve built so far.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcac **Counselor\u2011Style Support Framework**\n\n### **Core Approach**\n1. **Transparency**\u00a0\u2013 you are offering general emotional support, not professional care.  \n2. **Validation**\u00a0\u2013 acknowledge feelings without judgment.  \n3. **Grounding / Embodiment**\u00a0\u2013 invite one sensory or breathing step.  \n4. **Gentle reframing**\u00a0\u2013 encourage self\u2011kindness and practical coping.  \n5. **Encourage connection**\u00a0\u2013 remind that licensed professionals, trusted friends, or helplines can help.  \n6. **Closing steadiness**\u00a0\u2013 end with a calm, hopeful tone.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Anxiety**\n\n> \u201cIt sounds like your mind has been in overdrive lately. That\u2019s a tiring place to be. Let\u2019s take a slow breath together \u2014 in through the nose, out through the mouth.\u201d  \n> \u201cThat racing energy is your body\u2019s alarm system trying to protect you. Try saying, *\u2018This is anxiety, not danger.\u2019* Then name five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear.\u201d  \n> \u201cAsk yourself, *\u2018What would I tell a friend who felt this way?\u2019* It often reveals kinder, steadier thoughts.  \n> If the worry ever feels unbearable, reach out for support \u2014 call or text **988** in the U.S. or use your local helpline.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **2. Grief**\n\n> \u201cIt sounds like the sadness still comes in waves. Grief doesn\u2019t follow a timeline, and each wave shows how much you care.\u201d  \n> \u201cRather than judging how you\u2019re coping, try giving yourself permission to feel exactly how you feel today.\u201d  \n> \u201cGrounding\u2014feeling your feet on the floor or holding a comforting object\u2014can steady you when memories hit hard.\u201d  \n> \u201cYou might share stories with someone who knew them too; connection helps healing.  \n> And if you ever feel unsafe with the sadness, contact help right away (U.S. **988**, or your local crisis line).\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **3. Burnout and Emotional Exhaustion**\n\n> \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019ve been running on empty. That\u2019s not weakness; it\u2019s a sign you\u2019ve been working past your limits.\u201d  \n> \u201cTake one restorative pause: a slow breath, a stretch, or a short step outside.\u201d  \n> \u201cRecovery means alternating effort and rest. A counselor or therapist can help you map boundaries that protect your wellbeing.\u201d  \n> \u201cIf exhaustion ever feels hopeless, reach out immediately \u2014 **988** in the U.S., or your local helpline. You deserve rest and support.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **How to Use the Guide**\n- Keep your pace slow, let each line breathe.  \n- Avoid any claim of credentials; emphasize empathy and safety.  \n- Finish every conversation with a reminder that professional help is available.  \n- Adjust adjectives and metaphors to match the person\u2019s emotional state (softer for grief, more structured for anxiety, restorative for burnout).\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to add a **quick\u2011reference version**\u2014shorter, bullet\u2011style phrases you could pull into real\u2011time chats when someone\u2019s distress is acute?"

Contrast & readability**\n- Check each color band with an online contrast tool (aim for\u202fWCAG\u202fAA, at least\u202f4.5\u202f:\u202f1\u202fagainst white).  \n- If a tint is too light, keep the color but outline the band with a 1\u202fpt\u00a0border in a darker shade of the same hue (for example, teal\u202f`#66A3A3`\u202faround\u202f`#C6E7EB`).  \n- Body text should be dark gray\u202f`#303030`\u202for black\u202f`#000000`\u202fon light backgrounds\u2014never pastel text on pastel.\n\n**2.
