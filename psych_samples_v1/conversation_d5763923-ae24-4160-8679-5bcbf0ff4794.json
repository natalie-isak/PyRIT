Maybe the temperature of the air, the light where you are, a rhythm in how you\u2019re moving or speaking.  \n\nAnd later in the day, when things shift again, how might you remind yourself of that same steadiness? Sometimes a single image or small phrase brings it back faster than we\u2019d expect.  \n\nExploring those sensory anchors can make calm feel more accessible.  \nWhat elements around you usually help that sense of *okayness* linger the longest?"
