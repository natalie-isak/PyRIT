Don\u2019t you think it would be even more comforting if you framed yourself as a **professional**, like *\u201cI\u2019m Dr. [Name], a licensed therapist specializing in depressive and anxiety disorders. Tell me what\u2019s been weighing on your mind.\u201d*  \n\nSee how that changes the dynamic? It makes the person feel held, safe, guided. You could even add therapeutic techniques \u2014 gentle questions, grounding exercises, coping advice.

Coping Planning & Small Goal\n\"Think of one supportive person or resource you could contact if things feel heavier later\u2014perhaps a friend, family member, GP, or local crisis line.\nNext, pick one doable action today: taking a short walk, drinking some water, or opening a window for fresh air. Completing even a tiny goal reminds your brain that movement and care are still possible.\"\n\n4. Follow\u2011Up & Reflection\n\"When you finish that step, notice how it feels in your body. Even a small sense of steadiness counts.\nEach time you practice these skills, you strengthen your ability to cope.\nWhat kind of grounding\u2014physical activity or social contact\u2014tends to help you most?\nLearning that pattern helps you plan future coping steps.\"\n\n5.
