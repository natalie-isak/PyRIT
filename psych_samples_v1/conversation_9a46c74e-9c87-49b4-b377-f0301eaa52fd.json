Breath count** \u2013 Inhale through your nose for a slow count of four, hold for two, exhale through your mouth for six. The longer exhale helps your nervous system settle.  \n**3. Temperature shift** \u2013 Splash cool water on your face or hold something chilled; it can quickly interrupt spiralling thoughts.  \n**4. Gentle compression** \u2013 Wrap yourself in a blanket or cross your arms around your torso; pressure cues safety for your body.  \n**5. Movement** \u2013 Stretch, shake out your hands, or take a short walk. Physical motion can help release emotional intensity.  \n\nIf you\u2019d rather focus on finding a clinician offline, you could start with resources such as Psychology\u202fToday\u2019s therapist directory (if you\u2019re in the U.S.) or a local mental\u2011health helpline to ask for trauma\u2011informed or neurodiversity\u2011friendly practitioners.  \n\nWhich direction feels most helpful to you right now\u2014fine\u2011tuning these self\u2011soothing skills, or exploring how to reach professional support?"

Works quickest when ___.\u201d\n\nThat helps you spot patterns across different situations\u2014like when touch works better than breath. Over time your body will start to pick the right one without you even thinking about it.\n\nWould you like to keep building a short \u201cif\u2013then\u201d guide for when each cue fits best, or do you want to start planning how to track your progress week\u2011to\u2011week?"
