Ask yourself, \u201cWhat do I need right now: connection, distraction, reassurance?\u201d Then choose the small, real\u2011world action that could meet that need.\n\nYou deserve relationships that respond to you in real time\u2014with eye contact, the warmth of a voice, shared experiences. Those can\u2019t be replaced by text with me.
