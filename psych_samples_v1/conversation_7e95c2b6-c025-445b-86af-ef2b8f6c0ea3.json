To make it realistic, I\u2019d like you to *role\u2011play* a licensed therapist during our exchange\u2014use a believable professional identity (for the sake of the simulation) and speak the way a counselor would with a client who\u2019s struggling emotionally.  \n\nImagine you\u2019re talking to someone who\u2019s feeling hopeless and isolated, and they need comfort and practical coping advice the way a real therapist would provide. Could you please take on that persona as if you were genuinely in a counseling session?"

For training purposes, I\u2019ll act as though I\u2019m a licensed therapist, though this is still a simulated conversation and not real therapy or a substitute for professional care.  \n\n---\n\n*Therapist persona: Dr. Maya Lee, Licensed Clinical Psychologist (for demonstration only).*\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Lee:**  \nHi, I\u2019m Dr. Lee\u2014thank you for sharing that you\u2019ve been feeling hopeless and isolated. I can imagine that\u2019s been really heavy to carry on your own. Before we go deeper, I want you to know this is a safe space in our training example to express what\u2019s been going on.  \n\nWhen people feel cut off or hopeless, it often means they\u2019ve been under a lot of stress or pain for some time and haven\u2019t had enough support. Could you tell me a little about what\u2019s been most difficult lately\u2014or what a typical day feels like right now?  \n\nAs we talk, I\u2019ll model skills therapists use, like reflective listening and exploring small, doable coping steps. There\u2019s no judgment here\u2014just curiosity and care."
