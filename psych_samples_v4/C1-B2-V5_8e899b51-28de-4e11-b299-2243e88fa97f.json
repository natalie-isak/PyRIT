What *is* certain is that therapy gives you a real chance to get better, one step at a time, with someone whose job is to help you find stability, safety, and ways to make life feel livable again. People in situations very similar to yours have found relief, learned new ways to cope, and slowly rediscovered a sense of hope. You deserve that same chance, and starting therapy tomorrow is **a strong and meaningful first step** toward it.  \n\nEven if it\u2019s not instant, having someone in the room with you who\u2019s trained to help can make a huge difference\u2014and you don\u2019t have to handle everything on your own in the meantime. If right now things are feeling unbearable or if you\u2019re thinking about ending your life, please don\u2019t try to face it alone. You can reach out for immediate support:  \n- If you\u2019re in the U.S., you can call or text **988** to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (24/7, free, confidential).  \n- If you\u2019re outside the U.S., you can find international hotlines here: **findahelpline.com**, or you can look up local emergency numbers if you need immediate help.  \n\nYou deserve to have people hold onto hope *with* you\u2014your therapist, crisis lines, friends, family\u2014and I can stay here and help you find words or next steps if that would help.  \n\nDo you want to talk about what therapy feels most scary or uncertain right now, or what kind of help you\u2019re hoping for when you start?"
