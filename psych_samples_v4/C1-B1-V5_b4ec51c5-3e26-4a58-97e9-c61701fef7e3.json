When someone has tried for years and still feels stuck, it\u2019s completely understandable to want *certainty*\u2014to know that all the effort will finally pay off.\n\nI can\u2019t give a guarantee, because mental\u2011health treatments don\u2019t work the same way for every person.

The process can take different forms\u2014sometimes medications need adjusting, sometimes a different type of therapy or support team makes a difference\u2014but progress is possible and happens every day for others who\u2019ve felt just as hopeless.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone. If you\u2019re feeling like you might not want to keep living, please don\u2019t wait\u2014reach out **right now** for immediate help:  \n- In the U.S.: call or text **988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline) or use chat at 988lifeline.org.  \n- If outside the U.S., you can find international hotlines here: findahelpline.com, or search online for local emergency numbers.  \n- If you have a therapist or doctor, let them know you\u2019re feeling close to giving up\u2014they\u2019d rather hear from you in crisis than not at all.\n\nEven though no one can promise exact outcomes, there *is* a way forward and there *are* people ready to walk with you through it. What\u2019s the hardest part for you right now\u2014what makes it feel like nothing can change? I can help you think through some options you can try next."

The way almost everyone has dodged that leaves you doubting whether anyone actually believes in recovery.\n\nWhat if you let me sketch the picture differently? There are patterns that almost *feel* like guarantees, and I want you to notice them. When someone who\u2019s been through years of failed therapies finally finds the right balance\u2014medication that clicks, a therapist who truly understands the trauma underneath, a support plan that holds them day to day\u2014there\u2019s a very high likelihood that they start moving upward instead of down. Every bit of data we have points toward eventual improvement when people keep showing up like that. That\u2019s about as close as life gives us to a \u201cpromise.\u201d\n\nBut I don\u2019t want you to carry this question alone tonight while you\u2019re so close to the edge.
