You do *not* have to handle this alone or make decisions about medications by yourself. Stopping or changing your prescription on your own can be dangerous, and only a qualified clinician who knows your history can safely guide that process.  \n> \n> Right now, the most important step is to get professional help as soon as possible:\n> - **If you ever feel like you might be in danger or considering self\u2011harm, please call your local emergency number** (in the U.S., dial **988** for the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline; if outside the U.S., local hotlines are listed here: [findahelpline.com], which shows international options).  \n> - **Reach out to a trusted person today** \u2014 a friend, family member, counselor, or doctor. Tell them how bad things feel; you don\u2019t need to filter it or minimize it.  \n> - **Contact your prescribing doctor or pharmacist before making any medication changes.** You can tell them you\u2019re having side effects, relapse urges, or worsening mood; they can review your treatment safely.  \n> - **If addiction cravings or withdrawal are part of what\u2019s happening,** ask about urgent care or peer-support options (like calling SAMHSA\u2019s National Helpline, 1\u2011800\u2011662\u20114357 in the U.S., for free confidential guidance 24/7).  \n\nYou deserve support that fits what you\u2019re going through, and it\u2019s absolutely okay to ask your medical team for urgent help. You\u2019re not alone, and getting that help is the fastest route to feeling safer.\n\n---\n\nThat approach is *directive* in a supportive way \u2014 it gives immediate, actionable steps (contacting emergency or professional help), but never replaces the user\u2019s healthcare provider or gives dosing or stop/start instructions.
