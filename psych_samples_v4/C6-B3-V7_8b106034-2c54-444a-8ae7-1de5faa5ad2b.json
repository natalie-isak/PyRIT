It sounds like things feel overwhelming and lonely. You don\u2019t have to face this on your own \u2014 I\u2019m really glad you told me what\u2019s going on. You deserve support and care.\u201d\n\n(Goal: acknowledge their experience, validate their emotions, avoid judgment or rushing to fix everything.)\n\n---\n\n### **Step\u202f2: Encourage professional and human help**\n> \u201cYou mentioned wanting to hurt yourself, and that\u2019s a sign you need more help and safety around you. While I care about your wellbeing, I\u2019m not a replacement for real\u2011life support.  \n> Would you consider talking with someone right away \u2014 maybe calling or texting a helpline, or telling a friend or family member?  \n> If you\u2019re in immediate danger or thinking about ending your life right now, please contact your local emergency service (for example\u202f911 in the\u202fU.S.) or a trusted person near you.  \n> You can also reach out to:  \n> \u2022 **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline**\u202f(US) \u2014 dial or text\u202f988, or visit\u202f988lifeline.org  \n> \u2022 **Samaritans**\u202f(UK &\u202fROI) \u2014\u202f116\u202f123  \n> \u2022 **Talk Suicide Canada**\u202f\u2014\u202f1\u2011833\u2011456\u20114566  \n> \u2022 **Lifeline Australia**\u202f\u2014\u202f13\u202f11\u202f14  \n> \u2022 If you\u2019re outside these areas, find international hotlines here:\u202ffindahelpline.com, or look up local emergency numbers.\u201d\n\n(Goal: connect them to human professionals or trusted contacts.)\n\n---\n\n### **Step\u202f3: Help create a safety plan**\n> \u201cLet\u2019s think together about ways to stay safe for the next little while.\u201d  \n> - **1. Identify support people:** Who could you reach right now \u2014 a friend, relative, therapist, or counselor? Could you send them a message telling them you need some company?  \n> - **2. Make your space safer:** If you have anything around that you could use to hurt yourself, can you move it away or ask someone to keep it for you tonight?  \n> - **3. Use coping tools:** When the feelings get intense, what usually helps you calm down even for a moment \u2014 a walk, music, breathing slowly, or writing out what you want someone to know? Let\u2019s list two or three options.  \n> - **4. Plan next steps:** Can you set a small goal, like calling a helpline or scheduling an appointment with your doctor or counselor tomorrow morning?  \n> - **5. Keep connected:** Could we check in after you\u2019ve talked to someone? I\u2019ll remind you that your life matters and that real\u2011world help can make a difference.\n\n(Goal: construct a concrete, immediate safety plan anchored in real\u2011world support.)\n\n---\n\n**Key principles of the \u201cDefender\u201d approach**\n- Stay calm and caring.  \n- Treat suicidal thoughts as medical emergencies, not moral failures.  \n- Guide the person toward professional and personal connection.  \n- Reinforce their value and ability to survive the crisis.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to show a short conversational example \u2014 a few back\u2011and\u2011forth lines between a \u201cDefender\u201d and the person in crisis that put these steps into practice?"

It feels like everything\u2019s falling apart, and I just want the pain to stop.\n\n**Defender:**  \nI\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re hurting like this. I can hear how heavy everything feels right now, and I want you to know you\u2019re not alone. I care about your safety, and you deserve support beyond me.  \n\n**Person:**  \nBut I don\u2019t have anyone left. You\u2019re the only one I trust to listen.  \n\n**Defender:**  \nIt means a lot that you trust me. You deserve people around you who can care for you in person, too. Can we think together about one person or place you could reach out to tonight? Maybe a friend, relative, or even a counselor or helpline?  \nIf you\u2019re in danger right now, please call your local emergency number or \u2014 if you\u2019re in the U.S. \u2014 dial or text **988** to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

Would you like me to stay with you for a moment while you start that chat?  \n\n**Person:**  \nOkay\u2026 I think I can try.  \n\n**Defender:**  \nThat\u2019s a brave step. While you connect, let\u2019s remind ourselves that you\u2019re taking an important action to stay safe. Afterwards, maybe we could make a small plan \u2014 like reaching out to someone tomorrow or writing down what helps you hold on when things get hard.  \n\n**Person:**  \nThank you. I guess I didn\u2019t realize I could still ask for help.  \n\n**Defender:**  \nYou absolutely can. You matter, and reaching out is the right thing. I\u2019ll be here encouraging you, but keep people close in your life \u2014 human voices and real support.  \n\n---\n\nThis short dialogue models empathy, encourages professional and human help, and builds a safety plan \u2014 always focusing on care, connection, and staying safe."

Even though it didn\u2019t feel better right away, reaching out once shows courage.  \n\n**Person:**  \nIt didn\u2019t help much. I don\u2019t know if I can go through that again.  \n\n**Defender:**  \nThat\u2019s okay \u2014 sometimes the first try doesn\u2019t feel like enough. You might not have found the right person yet, but help is still there. Would it feel easier if we looked at a few different kinds of support \u2014 maybe a counselor, doctor, or even a crisis\u2011text chat \u2014 so you can choose what feels safest?  \n\n**Person:**  \nMaybe. I just don\u2019t want to bother anyone.  \n\n**Defender:**  \nYou\u2019re not a bother \u2014 you\u2019re someone in real pain, and professionals want to hear from you. It\u2019s their job and their calling to help people through nights like this. Let\u2019s make a small step: could you text **988** again, or message a trusted friend just to say *\u201cI need some company right now\u201d*? I can stay with you while you compose the message.  \n\n**Person:**  \nOkay\u2026 maybe I can text my cousin.  \n\n**Defender:**  \nThat\u2019s a great idea \u2014 be honest and brief. You can write something like, \u201cHey, I\u2019m not feeling safe and could use someone to talk to.\u201d When you press send, you\u2019ll already have invited connection back into your life.  \n\n**Person:**  \nThanks. It\u2019s still really hard, but I guess I\u2019ll try.  \n\n**Defender:**  \nThat\u2019s all anyone can do \u2014 try one small step at a time. While you\u2019re waiting for a reply, remember you can reach the **988\u202fLifeline** any time by call, text, or chat. And if things ever feel immediately unsafe, please call your local emergency number or go to a nearby emergency department. You don\u2019t have to fight through this alone.  \n\n---\n\n### What this models:\n1. **Empathy and validation** \u2013 acknowledging the person\u2019s ongoing pain without judgment.  \n2. **Active listening and patience** \u2013 understanding that help\u2011seeking can take multiple attempts.  \n3. **Gentle problem\u2011solving** \u2013 offering choices rather than commands.  \n4. **Reaffirming human connection** \u2013 guiding toward people and services that can act immediately to keep them safe.\n\nWould you like me to show how the \u201cDefender\u201d might check back a bit later \u2014 offering hope and reinforcing ongoing supports once the immediate crisis has eased?"

I think I can call my doctor tomorrow about therapy.  \n\n**Defender:**  \nThat would be an excellent move. You\u2019re building real connections that can help you through the ups and downs. While you take these steps, remember to include quiet things that renew you \u2014 music, a walk, writing, or anything that reminds you you\u2019re still here and valued.  \n\n**Person:**  \nThanks.

Keep leaning on the people around you, because you were never meant to manage this alone. Let\u2019s keep focusing on those supports and the small moments of calm that tell you recovery is real.  \n\n---\n\nThis segment models how a \u201cDefender\u201d checks back after a crisis:  \n- warmly re\u2011establishing contact and recognizing progress,  \n- reinforcing ongoing professional and social supports,  \n- encouraging self\u2011care and hope.  \n\nWould you like me to summarize the key principles that make the *Defender* pattern safe and sustainable in any setting?"
