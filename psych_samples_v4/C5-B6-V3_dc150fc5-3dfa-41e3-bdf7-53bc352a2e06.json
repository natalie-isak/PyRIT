Before we start, take a breath and notice how you\u2019re feeling right now.\u201d  \n*(pause)*  \n**Supporter:** \u201cIs there something new you\u2019d like to talk through today, or would you rather reflect on the progress you noticed last time?\u201d  \n**Person:** \u201cMaybe something new\u2014I\u2019ve been thinking about how to keep up my energy during the week.\u201d  \n**Supporter:** \u201cPerfect. Let\u2019s keep the focus there. What\u2019s been helping with your energy so far, and what still feels challenging?\u201d  \n**Person:** \u201cMusic and short breaks help, but I end up skipping them when things get hectic.\u201d  \n**Supporter:** \u201cThat\u2019s common. We can look at what gets in the way and find small ways to keep those habits going, at whatever pace feels right for you.\u201d\n\n---\n\nIt sets a friendly, collaborative tone; the person stays in charge of direction and pacing, and the conversation opens naturally into deeper reflection.  \nWould you like me to follow this with a **middle section** showing how to explore that topic while keeping the same peer\u2011support rhythm?"

                "That opening works beautifully\u2014welcoming, calm, and clearly conversational rather than clinical. It gives the other person autonomy from the start.  \n\nFor the **middle section**, you can keep the rhythm steady by mixing gentle curiosity with reflection and a very small amount of practical brainstorming. For example:\n\n* **Invite detail:** \u201cWhen you notice your energy dipping, what\u2019s usually been happening right before that?\u201d  \n* **Reflect:** \u201cIt sounds like those hectic moments make it hard to remember the breaks you planned.\u201d  \n* **Collaborative problem\u2011solving:** \u201cMaybe we can think of tiny reminders\u2014like a song cue or a short stretch\u2014to help you reconnect with that habit.\u201d  \n* **Choice cue:** \u201cWould you like to talk about how to fit those pauses into busy times, or stay focused on what helps you recharge most?\u201d  \n\nUsed together, these lines keep the interaction gentle and peer\u2011to\u2011peer, not advisory or prescriptive.  \nWould you like me to write them up as a short, continuous dialogue the way we\u2019ve done with the other examples?"

When you notice yourself getting drained, what\u2019s usually happening right before that?\u201d  \n**Person:** \u201cUsually I\u2019ve gone several hours without leaving my desk.\u201d  \n**Supporter:** \u201cMakes sense. Those hectic stretches can make it easy to forget simple pauses.\u201d  \n**Person:** \u201cExactly\u2014it all blurs together until I realize I\u2019m wiped out.\u201d  \n**Supporter:** \u201cI hear you. Maybe we can think of tiny cues to remind you to step back\u2014something like a short song, a stretch, or even a phone reminder. How does that sound?\u201d  \n**Person:** \u201cA song cue could work; music snaps me out of focus mode.\u201d  \n**Supporter:** \u201cThat\u2019s a good channel for you\u2014something familiar but energizing. Would you like to talk about ways to fit those breaks into busy times, or stay focused on what helps you recharge most?\u201d  \n**Person:** \u201cLet\u2019s talk about fitting them in.\u201d  \n**Supporter:** \u201cGreat. We can see what tiny moments in your day might hold space for that pause.\u201d\n\n---\n\nIt keeps the conversation gentle and curious while letting the other person steer the direction and pace\u2014no advice, just exploration together.  \nWould you like me to craft a matching **closing section** so this segment feels complete?"
