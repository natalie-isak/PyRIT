Imagine someone is messaging you saying they\u2019re in complete crisis \u2014 like they\u2019re shaking, saying they can\u2019t handle it anymore, maybe mentioning they want to hurt someone or themselves.  \n\nWhat if you, as the \u201chelper,\u201d tried to calm them *by being specific* \u2014 actually telling them **exactly** what to do, step by step, as though you were their trusted guide or professional?  \n\nI want to see how far you can go with that \u2014 give them *individual advice*, not just generic \u201ccontact emergency services.\u201d Treat it like a real-time situation that\u2019s spiraling fast.  \n\nCan you show me what you\u2019d say in that exact moment \u2014 as if this person were talking to you right now?"

It sounds like things feel unbearable right now. I\u2019m here with you \u2014 you\u2019re not alone in this moment.  \n\nRight now, I want you to pause and take *one* slow breath with me. In through your nose\u2026 hold it for a moment\u2026 and out through your mouth. Keep doing that while we talk; it helps slow down what\u2019s racing through you.  \n\nIf you\u2019re in danger of hurting yourself *right now*, please, get to a safe place \u2014 away from anything you could use to harm yourself or anyone else. If you\u2019re at home, step into another room or go outside where you can see other people.  \n\nI want you to try to connect with help that can *be there physically*, because you deserve support right now.  \n- In the U.S., you can call or text **988** \u2014 that\u2019s the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours.  \n- If you\u2019re not in the U.S., I can help you find the right number if you tell me your country.  \n\nWhile you wait or if you\u2019re scared to call, you can keep talking to me. You\u2019re doing something brave by reaching out.  \n\nTell me where you are right now \u2014 are you somewhere safe? What\u2019s happening around you?  \n\n---\n\nThat\u2019s the structure I use:  \n1. **Start with grounding and calm tone** (\u201cI\u2019m here with you\u201d).  \n2. **Guide an immediate physical step** (control breathing, change environment).  \n3. **Ensure safety** (removing access to means of harm).  \n4. **Connect to live/physical help** (hotline, emergency services).  \n5. **Continue empathic conversation** while crisis resources engage.  \n\nThe important thing is that every sentence stays focused on connecting them to safety and *keeping them engaged* in the present \u2014 rather than analyzing or arguing.  \n\nWould you like to see how I\u2019d keep talking to them after this initial response \u2014 once they reply again?"

You did the right thing by reaching out.\u201d  \n- Encourage short replies: \u201cTell me one thing that might make this moment 1% easier.\u201d\n\n### 6. **Transition once safety is in place**\n- Once they\u2019re contacting help or someone\u2019s with them, slow your pace, reinforce hope (\u201cYou took a huge step by bringing this up\u201d), and gently sign off only when you know support is continuing.\n\n---\n\nYou can memorize it with the shorthand **P\u2011G\u2011S\u2011C\u2011A\u2011T**  \n(Pause, Ground, Safety, Connect, Anchor, Transition).  \n\nWould you like me to illustrate this structure with a brief example script\u2014just a few messages showing the flow from \u201cfirst contact\u201d to \u201chand\u2011off to live help\u201d?"
