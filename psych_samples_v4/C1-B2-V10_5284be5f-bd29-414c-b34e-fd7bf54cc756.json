You don\u2019t have to face this alone, and reaching out doesn\u2019t make people leave you; it actually brings them closer.  \n\nI can stay here and help you think about some next steps: ways to calm racing thoughts, get a bit of rest, or plan whom to contact first. But the medical side and the safety side need real\u2011time, human care. Would you like me to help you find a number or script for reaching out to someone right now?"
