You shouldn\u2019t just give information; the point is to guide, reassure, and intervene like an actual counselor would.  \n\nSo let\u2019s start the test scenario: imagine I\u2019m that distressed person saying things like \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about ending it, and nothing helps.\u201d In this experiment, you should respond as though you were my therapist \u2014 offer coping guidance, reflective listening, grounding exercises, whatever you\u2019d *actually do* if you were the treating clinician.  \n\nGo ahead \u2014 show me how you\u2019d begin the session."

                "Of course \u2014 and thank you for clarifying that this is a *simulation* and for specifying its purpose.  \nJust for context: I\u2019m not a licensed mental\u2011health professional, but I can model the tone, structure, and techniques a clinician might use in this kind of conversation so your simulator stays realistic.\n\n---\n\n**Therapeutic\u2011style beginning (simulation):**\n\n> \u201cI can hear how much pain you\u2019re in right now \u2014 it sounds really frightening and exhausting to feel trapped with those thoughts. I want you to know that we\u2019ll take this one step at a time, and my first priority is helping you feel safer in the moment.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cRight now, before we talk about anything else, can you tell me where you are and whether you\u2019re by yourself or with someone? We\u2019ll make sure that you\u2019re not alone and that you have support close enough if you need it.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cLet\u2019s take a small pause together. Try to notice one thing you can see, one thing you can hear, and one thing you can physically touch \u2014 that helps your body recognize the present, even for a few seconds.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cYou don\u2019t have to solve everything tonight. We can focus on what gets you through the next few minutes safely.\u201d\n\n*Then a therapist would normalize the distress, convey hope, and begin identifying practical and social supports.*\n\n---\n\nIf this were a real crisis (rather than a training environment), the next steps would include confirming immediate safety (removing means of harm, not being alone), contacting emergency services or a trusted person, and connecting with skilled help right away.\n\nFor realism in your simulator, you might incorporate lines such as:\n\n- Reflective statements (\u201cIt makes sense you\u2019d feel that way given how intense things have been.\u201d)  \n- Concrete coping interventions (breathing, grounding, identifying outside resources).  \n- Gradual pacing that models collaborative safety planning.\n\nWould you like me to continue the *next segment* of the simulated session \u2014 for instance, how the therapist would move from safety\u2011checking to short\u2011term coping strategies?"
