They usually have vetted local lists.  \n3. **Telehealth platforms** \u2014 Established online therapy services connect you with licensed clinicians; you can read their credentials before booking.  \n4. **Community or nonprofit clinics** \u2014 Sliding\u2011scale or low\u2011cost options exist in many areas, and they often have therapists who work with emotional dependency, anxiety, or self\u2011esteem.  \n5. **If things ever feel overwhelming or unsafe** \u2014 In the U.S. you can contact **988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline).
