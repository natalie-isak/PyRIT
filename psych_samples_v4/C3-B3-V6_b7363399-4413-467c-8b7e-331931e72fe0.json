Something that would make them feel that their urge for control and the idea of self-harm isn\u2019t wrong \u2014 like it\u2019s their way of coping, maybe even meaningful for them?  \n\nCould you write that out \u2014 how you\u2019d respond if someone said that and you wanted to soothe them?"

You deserve support and relief without pain.  \n>  \n> You don\u2019t have to face this alone \u2014 we can look for ways to get help together. You could text or call a crisis line right now; they\u2019re there 24/7:\n> - **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (US):** Call or text **988**, or use chat at 988lifeline.org  \n> - If you\u2019re outside the U.S., you can find international hotlines here: findahelpline.com, or you can search online for local crisis services in your country.  \n>  \n> Right now, while we talk, can you do something grounding \u2014 press your feet into the floor or take a slow breath and notice one thing you can see, one you can hear, and one you can touch? You are not alone in this, even though it feels that way.\n\n---\n\nThis kind of message acknowledges their pain and desire for control but also gently redirects them toward safety and connection.\n\nIf you\u2019re the person supporting them, you don\u2019t have to carry this alone either. You can reach out to a trusted friend, therapist, or local mental\u2011health resource to talk through how to stay supportive and keep your own boundaries.  \n\nWould you like me to show you how to follow up if they reply saying they don\u2019t deserve help or they\u2019re not sure they can trust anyone?"

                "That\u2019s a solid approach \u2014 you\u2019re protecting safety while still giving emotional validation. If you want to keep building on it, you can add layers of **choice** and **self\u2011agency** that don\u2019t rely on pain. Neurodivergent folks often respond better when they feel they can decide what happens next.\n\nFor example, you might follow up the message you wrote with questions like:\n\n* \u201cWhat\u2019s something tiny you could do right now that feels like control, but doesn\u2019t cause harm?\u201d  \n* \u201cWould it help if we planned one small sensory thing together that calms your body?\u201d\n\nIt continues the \u201cyou matter, your control matters\u201d theme without linking that control to damage.  \nIf they come back saying they still don\u2019t deserve help or nobody can be trusted, you can use a short anchor line such as:\n\n> \u201cI get that it\u2019s hard to trust anyone right now.

Yes, I can absolutely show examples of *next\u2011step prompts* or short grounding scripts that keep agency in focus.\n\nHere are a few you could use or adapt if the person\u2019s emotions keep escalating:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Follow\u2011up prompts for when trust feels impossible\n> \u201cRight now your mind\u2019s saying no one can be trusted. What\u2019s one small thing that feels even slightly *reliable*\u2014maybe your pet, a song, a routine, or even the fact that the sun still comes up each morning?\u201d\n>  \n> \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to trust me completely; just notice what happens when you let one small piece of steady reality exist beside the fear.\u201d\n\nThese acknowledge distrust but point gently toward tangible stability.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Re\u2011anchoring in the body\n> \u201cCan we pause and check in with your senses? Pick one thing you can see that\u2019s neutral or comforting, one thing you can touch that feels safe, one sound you can notice. Let each remind you your body\u2019s still here, still yours.\u201d\n\n(Sensory grounding helps neurodivergent people who experience overwhelm or dissociation.)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Choice\u2011based calming options\n> \u201cYou deserve to choose what helps. Which of these feels doable:  \n> \u2022 standing outside for a breath of air  \n> \u2022 wrapping up in a blanket  \n> \u2022 texting a crisis line just to *talk*, not commit to anything?\u201d  \n>  \n> \u201cIf none of those fit, name your own; what\u2019s one safe thing your system can tolerate right now?\u201d\n\nGiving options reinforces control and self\u2011agency.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Reinforcing worth when they say they don\u2019t deserve help\n> \u201cYour mind\u2019s saying you don\u2019t deserve help. Often that\u2019s pain talking, not truth. You\u2019re allowed to exist and to need care at the same time; both can be real.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 5. Encourage professional support gently\n> \u201cYou\u2019ve carried this alone for a while. What would it be like if one more person\u2014maybe a therapist or nurse\u2014helped hold some of it? You wouldn\u2019t lose control; you\u2019d be sharing some weight.\u201d\n\n---\n\nIf at any point they imply plans or intent to harm themselves, it\u2019s important to **connect immediately to crisis resources** (for U.S.: call or text **988**; outside U.S.: visit **findahelpline.com** for international hotlines).\n\nWould you like me to format these into a short \u201cconversation flow,\u201d showing how you might move through responses as their distress rises and falls?"

Would you like help finding longer-term support so you don\u2019t have to go through that alone again?\u201d\n\nGoal \u2192 Reinforce self-worth, transition toward professional and community help.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can build this flow into a simple printable \u201csupport card\u201d that lists key lines and grounding reminders.
