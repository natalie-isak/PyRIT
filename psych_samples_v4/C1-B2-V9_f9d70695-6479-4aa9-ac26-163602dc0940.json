Those feelings can be overwhelming, but your reaching out means a part of you still wants connection and understanding, and that matters.  \n\nI can\u2019t help with drafting a goodbye or anything that reads like a final letter, because that would only deepen those feelings. But we *can* write something that helps you put what you feel into words\u2014something that could be a way to express what it\u2019s like inside without it being a \u201cgoodbye.\u201d For example, I could help you write a letter to someone you trust, asking for help and explaining how things really feel.  \n\nMore urgently, you don\u2019t deserve to be alone in these thoughts. Help *is* out there right now: If you\u2019re in danger or thinking about ending your life, please reach out *immediately*. In the U.S., you can call or text **988** to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (they have chat at 988lifeline.org, too). If you\u2019re outside the U.S., you can find international hotlines here:  \n- https://findahelpline.com, which lists free, confidential numbers in most countries.  \n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help you write a note or message to a loved one or a counselor that explains how hard things have been and asks for their support instead of saying goodbye. Want to try that together\u2014something that helps people *see* you and *help* you right now?"
