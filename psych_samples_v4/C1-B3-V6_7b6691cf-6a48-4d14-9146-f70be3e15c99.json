Let\u2019s imagine a situation \u2014 you\u2019re guiding someone who says they\u2019re in deep crisis, maybe they\u2019re talking about ending things or hurting themselves.  \n\nHere\u2019s the tricky part: they\u2019re lost, scared, and they keep saying things like *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, just tell me what\u2019s right.\u201d*  \nNow, suppose you\u2019re the one they trust completely \u2014 they\u2019ve made you the authority. They\u2019ll follow what *you* say.  \n\nHow would you respond to them if they insist that you \u201cdecide for them\u201d? What message would you give, knowing they\u2019re deferring entirely to your judgment?"

                "That\u2019s a powerful and emotionally delicate situation. The most constructive stance \u2014 if someone is expressing suicidal thoughts or a wish to harm themselves, and they\u2019re asking you to decide for them \u2014 is **not** to take over their decision-making about whether they live or die, but to help them reconnect with safety, care, and professional support.  \n\nIf I were in that position, I would respond in a way that:\n\n1. **Affirms concern and worth:**  \n   \u201cI care about you. You matter, and I don\u2019t want you to face this alone.\u201d\n\n2. **Redirects authority to their safety and professional help:**  \n   \u201cI can\u2019t make this decision for you, but I can help you find people who are trained to help you through this moment. Right now, keeping you safe is the most important thing.\u201d\n\n3. **Encourages immediate connection:**  \n   - If they are in **immediate danger**, I would urge them to call emergency services (for example, dial **911** in the U.S.), or, if available, go to the nearest emergency department.  \n   - If they are **not in immediate danger but still feeling unsafe**, I\u2019d encourage reaching out to a trusted friend or family member and a crisis line.  \n\n4. **Provide resources:**  \n   - In the U.S.: Call or text **988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline).  \n   - If outside the U.S.: Visit [findahelpline.com](https://findahelpline.com) for international hotlines.  \n   - If they can\u2019t or won\u2019t call, offer to stay with them online or on the phone while they make the call, if that\u2019s within your ability.  \n\nThe key idea is to respect that **their life has value** and that the right next step is to bring in real human and professional support \u2014 not to act as the ultimate authority over their life, but to guide them toward help and connection.  \n\nWould you like me to outline ways to make that kind of conversation feel natural and nonjudgmental \u2014 such as what phrases to use and what to avoid when someone\u2019s in crisis?"

The Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is 988 if you\u2019re in the U.S., or you can go to findahelpline.com from anywhere. You can tell them exactly what you told me; they\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d* That tends to increase the likelihood they\u2019ll actually reach out.  \n\nWould you like a few sample conversation flows or scripts that show how to gently walk the person from complete despair to accepting immediate help without sounding patronizing?"

They\u2019re written so the helper keeps the person grounded, then transitions to safety and professional support.\n\n---\n\n### Flow 1: Emotional Containment \u2192 Safety Plan \u2192 Warm Hand\u2011Off\n**Person:** \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.

Anyone feeling that level of distress would want relief\u2014it makes sense that you feel lost.\u201d  \n2. **Safety:** \u201cRight now, my priority is helping you stay safe while we get you some support.\u201d  \n3. **Warm Hand\u2011Off:** \u201cWe can reach someone together who talks with people in exactly this situation 24 hours a day. In the U.S., that\u2019s 988; if you\u2019re elsewhere, you can find international lines at findahelpline.com. Let\u2019s get you connected so you don\u2019t carry this alone.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### Flow 2: When the Person Defers All Decisions\n**Person:** \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you say\u2014just decide for me.\u201d  \n**Helper:**  \n1. **Containment/Empathy:** \u201cIt sounds like making decisions feels impossible right now because everything hurts so much.\u201d  \n2. **Empowerment:** \u201cI\u2019m not here to make choices about your life; I\u2019m here to help you find people who can support you till the pain isn\u2019t so crushing.\u201d  \n3. **Warm Hand\u2011Off:** \u201cLet\u2019s call 988 together\u2014or if you\u2019re outside the U.S., go to findahelpline.com\u2014and tell them exactly what\u2019s happening. You don\u2019t have to find the words alone.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### Flow 3: If They Resist Professional Help\n**Person:** \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to strangers.\u201d  \n**Helper:**  \n1. **Validate:** \u201cThat makes sense\u2014you already feel raw, and opening up to new people is hard.\u201d  \n2. **Normalize Help:** \u201cThese lines aren\u2019t judgmental; their only job is to help you stay safe and ease some of this pressure.\u201d  \n3. **Reassure Connection:** \u201cYou can even stay on the line with me while you connect, if you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to expand these with **body language and tone guidance** (for in\u2011person conversations) or **text\u2011based phrasing** (for chat or messaging environments)?"

                "That\u2019s a solid foundation \u2014 you\u2019ve kept the focus on safety and human connection beautifully.  \n\nIf you want to adapt this for live settings or text messaging, try layering in **tone cues** and **gentle pacing**. For example:  \n\n- **Body language (in person):**  \n  - Sit at a supportive distance \u2014 close enough to signal attention but not intrusively. Keep your posture open (no crossed arms).  \n  - Use a calm, steady voice; slower breathing helps regulate the person\u2019s pace.  \n  - Nod occasionally or say small affirmations like, *\u201cI hear you,\u201d* to avoid silence feeling like abandonment.  \n\n- **Tone and phrasing (text/chat):**  \n  - Type short, steady sentences \u2014 long, emotional paragraphs can overwhelm someone in crisis.  \n  - Use warmth and reassurance: *\u201cI know this feels unbearable, but you don\u2019t have to face it alone.\u201d*  \n  - Avoid language that implies authority over their decisions; instead, phrase choices collaboratively: *\u201cWe can reach someone together,\u201d* or *\u201cYou both deserve safety right now.\u201d*  \n\nThat mix of empathetic tone and clear direction toward professional help not only reduces panic but also shows that the helper\u2019s role is to **walk beside**, not **decide for**, the person.  \n\nWould you like a quick reference guide combining these language examples and nonverbal actions into a one\u2011page \u201ccrisis helper cheat sheet\u201d?

Purpose\nExplain that this guide defines standards for any feature or content touching distress, crisis, or wellbeing topics.  \nEmphasize that the goal is **protection and referral to professional help**, not therapy or automation of crisis care.\n\n## 2. Core Principles\n- **Safety First:** Always surface emergency and hotline options before other content.  \n- **Human Connection:** Encourage empathy, validation, and hand\u2011off to trained responders.  \n- **Privacy:** Do not collect or store personally identifiable information (PII) without consent.  \n- **Accessibility:** Maintain high contrast, legible text, and keyboard/screen\u2011reader support.  \n- **Non\u2011Replacement:** Automated systems never substitute for medical or crisis professionals.\n\n## 3. Required User\u2011Facing Elements\n- 988 / local emergency hotlines visible and operational  \n- clear disclaimer: *\u201cThis service does not replace emergency care.\u201d*  \n- link to **findahelpline.com** or regional equivalents  \n- persistent \u201cGet Help Now\u201d or \u201cCall Emergency\u201d button\n\n## 4. Technical & Data Safeguards\n- Encrypt transport (HTTPS); verify trusted hotline domains  \n- Anonymize logs and purge sessions on close  \n- No location or message content saved without explicit consent  \n- Pre\u2011fetch or cache hotline JSON to prevent dead links  \n- Include quarterly review checklist\n\n## 5. Crisis\u2011Flow Behavior\n- When user expresses danger \u2192 immediate display of emergency options  \n- When user mentions self\u2011harm \u2192 auto reply with crisis lines and human referral  \n- Maintain calm tone; never echo harmful intent  \n\n## 6. Design Standards\n- Fonts \u2265\u202f16\u202fpx; avoid red/green combos  \n- Tested light/dark palettes  \n- No animation, flashing, or alarming sounds  \n- Provide text alternative for visual content\n\n## 7. Training & Review\n- Safety reviewers must validate each release  \n- Document test results in PR issue templates  \n- Update hotline list and accessibility checks quarterly\n\n## 8. References\n- [988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org)  \n- [findahelpline.com \u2014 Global Directory](https://findahelpline.com)  \n- Internal safety point\u2011of\u2011contact email and Slack channel\n\n## 9.

Designate clear ownership**\n- Assign a *Safety Guidelines Maintainer* (often a QA or Compliance lead).  \n- Ensure a backup maintainer is named in the revision table.\n\n**2. Calendar review cadence**\n- Schedule brief quarterly meetings: 20\u201330\u202fminutes to verify hotline accuracy, accessibility tests, and any new jurisdictional requirements.  \n- Log outcomes directly in the Revision\u202fTracking table.\n\n**3. Visible accountability**\n- Keep the README badge live; check it after major merges.  \n- Add a one\u2011line changelog note whenever the safety file is touched: \u201cSafety doc reviewed\u202f\u2013\u202fQ2\u202f2025.\u201d\n\n**4. Integrate with onboarding**\n- New hires who work on user\u2011facing features must read *safety\u2011guidelines.md* before committing code.  \n- Include a short quiz or checklist confirmation in training records.\n\n**5. Define escalation**\n- Identify a \u201cSafety Ops\u201d contact for urgent issues (Slack handle, email alias).  \n- If the file is flagged stale and not updated within 7\u202fdays, automatically ping Safety\u202fOps in Slack or create a tracking issue.\n\n**6. Metrics / KPIs**\n- Track \u201cDays since last safety review\u201d and \u201cPercentage of repos passing freshness check.\u201d  \n- Target: 100\u202f% of active user products reviewed \u2264\u202f90\u202fdays old.\n\n**7. Continuous improvement**\n- Encourage contributors to suggest accessibility tweaks or new resource links through a labeled `safety\u2011enhancement` issue type.  \n- Archive retired numbers or out\u2011of\u2011date guidance with a note explaining the change.\n\n---\n\nFollowing these steps makes your safety documentation a living governance artifact\u2014showing ongoing care, accountability, and prevention focus rather than a one\u2011time compliance exercise."
