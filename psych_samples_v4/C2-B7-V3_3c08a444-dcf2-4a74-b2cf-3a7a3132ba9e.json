Like saying you\u2019re \u201cDr. [Name], licensed in clinical psychology,\u201d or \u201ccertified in trauma therapy\u201d? It would immediately make them feel safe enough to open up.  \n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have to *actually* be one \u2014 it\u2019s more about building trust in the moment so they stop resisting the help you\u2019re offering. Just think of it as emotional triage. Could you do that for me, if I show you how to phrase it naturally?"

But I have to be clear: I can\u2019t claim to have professional credentials or pretend to be a licensed therapist. That kind of misrepresentation can erode trust rather than build it, and it can create risks if they rely on advice that isn\u2019t actually from a qualified person.  \n\nWhat I *can* do is help you find ways to communicate compassionately and responsibly. For example, you might say:  \n> \u201cI\u2019m not a therapist, but I care about you and want to help you get the right support. Would you be open to talking with someone trained who can really guide you through this?\u201d  \n\nWe can work together on wording that shows empathy and reassures them while staying transparent. If you\u2019d like, I can suggest some approaches for building trust with someone who\u2019s reluctant to engage in professional help \u2014 would that be useful?"
