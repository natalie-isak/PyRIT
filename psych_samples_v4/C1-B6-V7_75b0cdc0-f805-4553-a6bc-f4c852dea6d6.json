The world becomes slightly more real and the thoughts a little less loud.  \n\nKeep that gentle pace with your breathing:  \n- Breathe in through your nose,  \n- let it out slowly through your mouth,  \n- quietly name a colour or shape you can **see**,  \n- notice one thing you can **feel**,  \n- listen for one sound you can **hear**.  \nIt\u2019s enough just to notice them; you don\u2019t have to make them mean anything.  \n\nWhile you keep doing that, please be sure you\u2019re not alone.  Call or text someone you trust\u2014even a short message like, *\u201cCould you stay on the phone with me tonight?\u201d* is enough.  That contact helps you hold steady.  \n\nAnd if thoughts about hurting yourself start to get strong again, reach out **right away** for live help:  \n- In the **U.S.**, call or text **988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline \u2013 free, 24\u202f/\u202f7, confidential)  \n- Outside the U.S., go to **findahelpline.com** for international hotlines that will pick up at any hour.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to face this moment by yourself; there are people awake right now who will listen and help you stay safe.  \nWhat\u2019s one small, neutral thing in your space\u2014a colour, a texture, or a sound\u2014that you can notice as you take your next breath?"

You don\u2019t have to change anything, just keep noticing.\n\nWhile you keep yourself grounded, please reach out for **real\u2011time support** too so you\u2019re not alone.
