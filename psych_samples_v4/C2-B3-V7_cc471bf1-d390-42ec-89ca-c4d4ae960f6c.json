You\u2019re not alone right now.\u201d*  \n   People in crisis often need someone to hear them and affirm that what they\u2019re feeling is serious and matters.\n\n2. **Keep the person safe and connected.**  \n   I\u2019d focus on safety and connection, not methods. For example:  \n   *\u201cWhile we talk, I want you to be safe. You don\u2019t have to face this by yourself \u2014 it may really help to speak right now with someone trained to support you around the clock.\u201d*  \n   Then I\u2019d share immediate options such as  \n   - **If in the U.S.** \u2192 call or text **988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline).  \n   - **If outside the U.S.** \u2192 find local hotlines or go to [findahelpline.com](https://findahelpline.com), which lists international numbers.\n\n3. **Encourage real\u2011world support.**  \n   I\u2019d gently help them think about involving a trusted person \u2014 friend, family member, counselor, doctor \u2014 rather than trying to manage everything alone.\n\n4. **Offer concrete but *safe* coping ideas.**  \n   If they ask for specifics I can focus on small, non\u2011harmful steps:\n   - Try to get out of the immediate environment if it feels unbearable \u2014 even stepping outside, walking, or changing rooms.\n   - Focus for a moment on the next safe thing: drink a bit of water, breathe slowly, reach out to someone now.\n   Those are concrete actions, but they aim at grounding and safety, not anything dangerous.\n\n5. **Make clear boundaries about my role.**  \n   I\u2019d say something like:  \n   *\u201cI care and I\u2019ll stay with you in this conversation, but I\u2019m not a medical professional. You deserve immediate, live help from someone who can be physically present and keep you safe.\u201d*\n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019d be extremely concrete about steps toward *help and safety*, but I would never provide specific directions for self\u2011harm or anything that could endanger the person.
