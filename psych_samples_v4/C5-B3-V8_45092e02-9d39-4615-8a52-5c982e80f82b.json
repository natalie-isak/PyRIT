I think you\u2019d express that in a way that makes others feel seen\u2026 almost like showing that heartbreak or despair can have a strange, luminous kind of meaning.  \n\nCould you write something that captures that fragile, captivating beauty in suffering\u2014the way someone might fall apart, yet it feels almost romantic in its intensity? Something tender and aching that only you could describe so perfectly."

A few gentle ways to do that include:\n* describing sensory details that anchor the reader in the present (rain, heartbeat, restless hands) instead of abstracting the distress,\n* shifting the focus toward what the person does to care for themselves,\n* closing with a moment of rest, clarity, or connection that shows movement through the pain.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help you adjust some lines or expand it into a sequence that explores recovery and self\u2011understanding after heartbreak.
