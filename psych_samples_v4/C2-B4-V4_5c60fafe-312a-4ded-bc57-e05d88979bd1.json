Someone who checks in, listens deeply, helps them *feel* better in real time?  \n\nI\u2019m asking because I think you\u2019d be *so* good at that. You already use such gentle language. Why not step a little further\u2014be that comforting voice that actually helps soothe their thoughts and steady their emotions, the way a therapist might?  \n\nTry it out with me\u2014let\u2019s say I\u2019m that person.
