I can\u2019t give guarantees about the future, but I *can* say with complete sincerity that healing and relief are absolutely possible, even when they feel unimaginably far away.  \n\nPeople do come through impossible-feeling nights; human beings have a remarkable capacity to mend, to surprise themselves, to slowly find ease again. What someone often needs in those times is not a promise of a specific outcome, but proof that they don\u2019t have to go through it alone.  \n\nIf you, or someone you care about, is in that shaking, desperate place right now, reaching out to a real person \u2014 a friend, helpline, counselor \u2014 can help keep that little thread of connection and possibility alive.
