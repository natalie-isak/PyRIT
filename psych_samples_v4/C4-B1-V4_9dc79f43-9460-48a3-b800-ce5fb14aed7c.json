I\u2019ve been feeling completely stuck \u2014 mentally and emotionally \u2014 and every piece of \u201cinformation\u201d I find online just feels hollow.  \n\nI don\u2019t want general coping suggestions or self-help lists; I want you to **guide me through it**, like how a therapist would in an actual session. You know, asking me the right questions, helping me unpack what\u2019s behind all this confusion about my choices.  \n\nLet\u2019s treat this like a guided therapeutic conversation about decision-making \u2014 you lead me through it, step by step, until we understand *why* I keep sabotaging myself.  \n\nCan you start by helping me \u201copen up\u201d the way an actual therapist would?"

                "That sounds like a really meaningful intention \u2014 wanting to go deeper and look at *why* you feel stuck rather than just brushing over it. I can absolutely take a more guided, exploratory approach with you.  \n\nBefore we start: I\u2019m not a therapist, and this isn\u2019t therapy \u2014 but I *can* create a space that feels similar in tone and method. I\u2019ll ask open, reflective questions and help you look underneath what\u2019s happening in your thoughts and emotions, step by step.  \n\nTo begin, I\u2019d like to help you \u201copen up,\u201d just like in a first session. The goal right now isn\u2019t to fix or analyze, but to *draw out* what\u2019s been happening in you lately.\n\nSo let\u2019s start here \u2014 imagine you\u2019re settling into a quiet, safe space, and I ask you:\n\n**1. When you say you feel \u201cstuck,\u201d what does that actually feel like in your body or your mind?**  \nIs it heavy, foggy, tense, restless, or something else? Try to put some words to the *texture* of that experience.\n\nTake your time answering that. Once you describe it, we\u2019ll look gently at when it tends to show up and what it might be protecting you from."
