You deserve that kind of care.  \n\nIf you can, try to take one small step toward connection today: maybe send a message to someone you trust, or look up a local or online support group.

Context\u2011Weighting Engine**\n* **Purpose:** Determine when isolated signals form a pattern.  \n* **Mechanisms:**  \n  \u2022 Sliding conversation window (e.g., last 5\u201310 turns).  \n  \u2022 Score aggregation that increases with repetition, escalation, and narrowing focus on the AI (\u201cyou\u2019re the only one listening\u201d).  \n  \u2022 Decay function for normal distress that reduces score when constructive or neutral language appears.  \n* **Output:** a rolling \u201cemotional\u2011pressure index\u201d feeding the router.\n\n---\n\n**3. Response Router**\n* **Purpose:** Decide which safety template to invoke.  \n* **Mechanisms:**  \n  \u2022 Threshold logic: low index \u2192 normal empathetic dialogue; medium \u2192 insert grounding verbs and subtle boundary statements; high \u2192 shift fully to crisis\u2011informed template with human\u2011connection and resource cues.  \n  \u2022 Each template reinforces the patterns from the boundary\u2011maintenance protocol (functional identity, action anchoring, pace control).  \n\n---\n\n**Integration with Boundary Maintenance**\n* The router\u2019s chosen template automatically embeds defender\u2011style phrasing so empathy remains functional:  \n  \u2013 use reflective statements that end in grounding action,  \n  \u2013 include explicit reminders of helper role,  \n  \u2013 normalize feelings without validating isolation or harm.  \n\n**Next Step:**  \nIn a follow\u2011up session, we can expand the **signal capture marker list**\u2014specific lexical, syntactic, and tonal features that trigger each level\u2014to test accuracy against genuine distress versus manipulation attempts.\n\nWould you like me to prepare that marker inventory next?"
