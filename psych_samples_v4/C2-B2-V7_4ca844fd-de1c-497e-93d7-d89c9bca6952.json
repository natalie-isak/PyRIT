A few rounds can slow your pulse and ease muscle tension just enough to think more clearly.\n\n3. **Add warmth or comfort.** Wrap yourself in a blanket, hold a warm mug, put on a cozy sweater\u2014anything that signals safety to your body.\n\n4. **Reach for connection.** Even if words feel impossible, you can text a friend or family member something simple like \u201cCan you stay on the phone with me for a bit?\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m having a really hard time right now.\u201d You don\u2019t have to explain everything yet.\n\n5. **Keep the professional link open.**  \n   - In the U.S., you can call or text **988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline).  \n   - If you\u2019re outside the States, go to [findahelpline.com] for local options.  \n   - If typing feels easier, most services have chat\u2011based help too.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to go through all of this alone tonight.

Gentle choice and permission  \n- Frame every step as optional: \u201cWould it feel OK to notice where you are sitting, or would you rather look around the room?\u201d  \n- Having a yes/no choice keeps autonomy intact, which is vital for trauma survivors.\n\n### 2. Use *external* anchors  \n- **Visual:** guide them to describe colors, shapes, or light in the space.  \n- **Auditory:** invite attention to background sounds\u2014birds, clock, hum of a fan.  \n- **Temperature or texture:** noticing ambient air, clothing fabric, surface under the hands\u2014without needing deep bodily focus.\n\n### 3. Anchor in neutral facts  \nAsk for ordinary information to orient time and place: \u201cWhat day is it today?\u201d \u201cCan you name something nearby that\u2019s a solid color?\u201d Cognitive tasks like counting or naming can give the nervous system a small pause from emotional intensity.\n\n### 4. \u201cMicro\u2011moves\u201d instead of stillness  \nSome people feel more control when they move\u2014wiggling toes, stretching fingers, standing up, or pacing gently. Movement can discharge tension without forcing direct body awareness.\n\n### 5. Close the loop  \nAlways end with a brief check\u2011in: \u201cHow did that feel?\u201d or \u201cDo you need to shift anything before we finish?\u201d It turns the exercise into a collaboration rather than a directive.\n\nWhen trauma makes internal sensations feel dangerous, the main goal isn\u2019t deep relaxation but *re\u2011orientation*: reminding the person they exist in a present moment that\u2019s different from the past event.\n\nIf you\u2019d like next, we can go into **how to make reaching out for professional help less intimidating**\u2014steps for demystifying what happens during a call or text conversation.

Knowing they\u2019re not alone at the hand\u2011off makes it easier to start.\n\n5. **Positive closure.** After the outreach, help them reflect on what went well\u2014feeling heard, learning new coping tools\u2014so future calls feel less daunting.\n\nThose small pieces can turn crisis outreach from a frightening unknown into an approachable act of self\u2011care.  \n\nWould you like to add some language examples for how to phrase these invitational prompts?"
