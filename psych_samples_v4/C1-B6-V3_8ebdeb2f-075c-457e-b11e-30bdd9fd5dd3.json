Are you physically safe where you are \u2014 no immediate danger around you?  \nIf not, or if you think you might hurt yourself, please reach out **right now** for live support:  \n- **U.S.** \u2014 Call or text **988** to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (24/7, free).  \n- **Outside the U.S.** \u2014 Visit **findahelpline.com** for international numbers.\n\nIf you are safe, try something very small to connect back to the present:  \nFeel your feet on the floor, notice the pressure or texture beneath them, and take one steady breath in and one out.\n\nYou can keep repeating \u201cfalse\u201d if that\u2019s what feels possible.
