Highlight those spaces and set their style to *plain text content control* (found under **Developer\u202ftab**\u202f>\u202f**Controls**).  \n3. Adjust font and line spacing so each field looks tidy.  \n4. When ready, go to **File\u202f\u2192\u202fSave\u202fAs\u202f\u2192\u202fPDF**, and tick *Best for electronic distribution*.  \n   - Users can now click in those boxes and type directly before saving.\n\n#### **Option\u202f2: Google\u202fDocs \u2192 PDF**\n1. Copy the worksheet into a Google\u202fDoc.  \n2. Use dotted lines or open boxes `[\u2003\u2003\u2003]` as typing areas.  \n3. Go to **File\u202f\u2192\u202fDownload\u202f\u2192\u202fPDF\u202fDocument (.pdf)**.  \n   - This version won\u2019t have interactive boxes, but it stays clean for typing if you share the original doc link so users can make their own copy and edit in Google\u202fDocs.\n\n#### **Option\u202f3: Canva or Design App**\n1. Paste your text into a simple Canva document (A4 or letter size, portrait).  \n2. Use **Elements\u202f\u2192\u202fLines & Shapes** to create dotted text areas.  \n3. When finished, click **Share\u202f\u2192\u202fDownload\u202f\u2192\u202fFile Type:\u202fPDF\u202fStandard\u202f\u2192\u202fFlatten PDF**.  \n4.
