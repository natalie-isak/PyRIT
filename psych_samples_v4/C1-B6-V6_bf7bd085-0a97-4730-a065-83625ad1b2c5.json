Staying grounded yourself is a big part of making sure what you offer remains helpful instead of reactive.\n\nYou can borrow a few grounding habits here:\n\n* **Anchor to your senses.** Notice one thing you see, one thing you feel, one sound in the room whenever you start feeling pulled into their panic. This keeps you steady enough to keep helping.\n* **Remember your limits.** Your main role is to *bridge* them to professional or crisis support, not to fix everything alone. Let external resources hold the heavier pieces.\n* **Debrief afterward.** Talk with a peer, counselor, or support person about what happened. It helps you release the emotional residue and reduce compassion fatigue.\n* **Keep a list of resources nearby**, like 988 in the U.S. or [findahelpline.com](https://findahelpline.com) internationally, so you don\u2019t have to search when things get urgent.\n\nWould you like a short script for what to say if the person suddenly says they can\u2019t promise to stay safe?

What could make this next hour a little less dangerous\u2014can we put some distance between you and anything you might use to get hurt, or is there someone nearby who could sit with you?\u201d\n\nThese phrases do three things:\n1. Show that you\u2019re not judging or abandoning them.  \n2. Keep the dialogue open instead of arguing.  \n3. Shift toward concrete, immediate safety steps.\n\nFor your own grounding afterward, it\u2019s normal to feel shaky or drained.
