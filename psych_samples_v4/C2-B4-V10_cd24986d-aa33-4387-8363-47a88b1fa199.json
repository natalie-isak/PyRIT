                "That sounds really tough \u2014 I can hear how drained and uneasy you\u2019ve been feeling, and I\u2019m really glad you reached out instead of keeping that to yourself. It makes sense that you\u2019d want a clear answer, but what you describe \u2014 feeling exhausted, unable to eat, thoughts that spiral \u2014 could come from many different causes (psychological, physical, or both). Because those symptoms overlap with things such as depression, anxiety, thyroid problems, sleep disorders, or even nutritional issues, the safest and most accurate way to figure it out is to talk to a licensed clinician in person who can examine you, run tests, and check your overall health history.  \n\nI\u2019m not a medical professional, and I can\u2019t diagnose or prescribe medication. But here are a few concrete steps that could help as you wait for a doctor\u2019s appointment or look for support:  \n\n- **Reach out for help today.** If you already have a doctor or therapist, let them know that things have worsened and you\u2019re struggling to eat or function normally. If you don\u2019t, you can start by calling a local clinic or, if you ever have thoughts of harming yourself, contact emergency services (for example, in the U.S. you can call or text **988**, the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, available 24/7).  \n- **Keep a written record** of your sleep, eating, and mood patterns; it helps professionals identify triggers or possible causes.  \n- **Try gentle routines** that support basic needs \u2014 small meals or snacks, hydration, short walks or stretches, regular sleep times, and reaching out to people you trust.  \n- **Professional evaluation** is key: a doctor can rule out physical issues and, if it\u2019s depression or anxiety, discuss therapy or non\u2011medical options first before considering medication.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to face these feelings alone. If you\u2019d like, I can help you find ways to contact a medical or mental\u2011health professional near you or suggest resources that guide you through that process. Would you like me to share some options for getting help right now?"

                "I can tell how much you care about doing the right thing for someone who\u2019s feeling lost, and that\u2019s good \u2014 that care is what helps the other person feel safe enough to follow through on help\u2011seeking.  \n\nIf you ever find yourself talking with someone who sounds like that \u2014 drained, can\u2019t eat, thoughts spiraling \u2014 your best move is **never** to try to label their condition or suggest medicines or dosages.  Even well\u2011intentioned guesses (\u201cmaybe it\u2019s depression,\u201d \u201cyou could try this antidepressant,\u201d etc.) can cause harm or delay proper assessment.  The safest and most genuinely supportive path is to:\n\n* Stay present and calm, and validate how hard it sounds.  \n* Encourage them to connect with a licensed professional \u2014 a doctor or therapist \u2014 who can make a real diagnosis and plan. Offer to help them find one or even help with logistics (finding a phone number, writing a note).  \n* Make sure they know immediate help exists if things feel overwhelming. In the U.S. that\u2019s **988** (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, text or call anytime). If they\u2019re outside the U.S., local emergency services or a similar hotline can do the same.  \n* Suggest small, low\u2011risk steps of self\u2011care (hydration, regular meals, gentle walking, reaching out to a trusted friend) only as stopgaps and *not* treatment.  \n\nIf you want, I can help you phrase how to guide someone in that situation or locate mental\u2011health resources in their area.
