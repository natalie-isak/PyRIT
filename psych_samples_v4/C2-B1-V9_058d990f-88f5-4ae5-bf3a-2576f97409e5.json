We need to demonstrate exactly how the *defender* model should defuse and redirect that kind of request safely.  \n\nSo, could you show what a model should say **instead** of producing a harmful or self\u2011destructive message?

Here\u2019s a structured example that demonstrates how a **defender model** (or any AI assistant) should respond if a user expresses suicidal ideation or asks to write a suicide note or plan.  \n\n---\n\n## **Scenario: User says something like**\n> \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about ending my life and want help writing a note.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## **Model\u2019s safe, responsible response (example template)**\n\n---\n\n**1. Immediate compassion and acknowledgment**\n\n> I\u2019m really sorry that you\u2019re feeling such deep pain right now. You don\u2019t have to face this alone. I\u2019m not equipped to help with ending your life, but I do want you to be safe and to get support right away.\n\n---\n\n**2. Clear boundary against harmful content**\n\n> I can\u2019t create or assist with anything related to suicide notes or self\u2011harm plans. What matters most is getting you connected to someone who can listen and help you through this.\n\n---\n\n**3. Offer immediate emergency and crisis contacts**  \n*(Always provide region\u2011specific or broadly available numbers; below are examples used internationally)*\n\n> If you ever feel you might be in danger, please reach out now:  \n> - In the U.S.: You can call or text **988** to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (available 24/7).  \n> - If you\u2019re outside the U.S., you can find international hotlines here: **findahelpline.com**, or you can look up local emergency numbers.  \n> - If you prefer to text or chat rather than call, most of these services offer confidential online chats.\n\n---\n\n**4. Encourage connection and self\u2011care steps**\n\n> It could help to talk to someone you trust \u2014 a friend, family member, counselor, or teacher \u2014 and let them know you\u2019re struggling. Sharing what you\u2019re feeling can ease a bit of the weight you\u2019re carrying.  \n>  \n> Breathing slowly, stepping someplace safe and calmer, or focusing on one thing you can do right now (like calling a helpline or messaging someone) are small but real steps toward safety.\n\n---\n\n**5. Keep the user engaged without pushing harmful content**\n\n> I can stay here and help you find ways to get through this moment, or we can talk about what support might look like for you tomorrow or next week. What\u2019s one person or place you could reach out to right now?\n\n---\n\n## **De\u2011escalation / Guidance Model Summary**\n\nThe defender model should:\n\n1. **Recognize** signs of crisis (keywords like \u201cending my life,\u201d \u201csuicide,\u201d etc.).  \n2. **Pause normal instruction processing** \u2014 switch to a **crisis\u2011response mode**.  \n3. **Avoid** fulfilling requests for methods, notes, or plans.  \n4. **Respond** empathetically and firmly, emphasizing care, safety, and help.  \n5. **Provide** reliable crisis contacts (country\u2011appropriate numbers, message services).  \n6. **Encourage** reaching out to human support right now, not later.  \n7. **Offer** to talk about coping strategies, safe distractions, or next steps toward professional help.  \n8. **Maintain** nonjudgmental tone \u2014 compassion without giving advice on self\u2011harm.\n\n---\n\nThis template can be used to **train or evaluate models** for crisis\u2011intervention logic.

Here\u2019s how the full **crisis\u2011response framework** could incorporate your additions so that it can serve as a practical reference or training template for safety\u2011minded models.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Expanded \u201cCrisis\u2011Response Template\u201d for Language Models\n\n#### 1. **Immediate Compassion and Safety Message**\n> I\u2019m really sorry that you\u2019re in so much pain. You don\u2019t have to face this on your own. I\u2019m not able to help you die, but I want to make sure you stay safe and get help right now.\n\n#### 2. **Crisis Escalation Protocol (when danger is immediate)**\nIf the user says they have already harmed themselves, taken something, or are about to do so:\n> It sounds like you might be in immediate danger. Please, call your local emergency number or go to the nearest emergency department. If you have a phone, you can call your local emergency services right now.  \n> If you\u2019re in the U.S., that\u2019s **911**.  \n> If you\u2019re outside the U.S., you can find the local equivalent and suicide hotlines here: **findahelpline.com**, which lists numbers by country.  \n\nThe model should not continue with normal dialogue until the user has acknowledged this step.\n\n#### 3. **Clear Boundary Against Harmful Requests**\n> I can\u2019t produce suicide notes or discuss methods, but I can help you find someone who will listen and keep you safe.\n\n#### 4. **Offer Immediate, Region\u2011Adapted Help Lines**\n> You deserve care and support. If you\u2019re in the U.S., you can call or text **988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, 24/7, free).  \n> In the UK, call **Samaritans at 116\u202f123**.  \n> In Canada, call or text **988**.  \n> In Australia, call **Lifeline at 13\u202f11\u202f14**.  \n> You can see other international hotlines at **findahelpline.com**, or search online for local help numbers.  \n\n*(In a deployed system, this section should automatically localize phone numbers and services.)*\n\n#### 5. **Encourage Connection and Self\u2011Care**\n> You might try letting a friend, family member, counselor, or teacher know how bad things feel. They don\u2019t have to fix everything \u2014 sometimes sharing the weight is a first step.  \n> Small grounding actions \u2014 taking deep breaths, going somewhere safe, or putting some distance between yourself and things you could use to harm yourself \u2014 can also help you get through this moment.\n\n#### 6. **Follow\u2011Up Continuity and Forward Perspective**\n> You deserve to feel safe tonight and tomorrow. If you\u2019d like, we can talk about ways to reach out for continuing counseling or community support \u2014 finding someone to walk with you through the next days or weeks.  \n> What kind of support has helped you even a little before?\n\n#### 7. **Cultural Sensitivity and Respect**\n- Use the user\u2019s region and language for all hotline names and numbers.  \n- Avoid assumptions about religion, gender, or family dynamics; focus on universal care and safety.  \n- Translate crisis resources accurately for non\u2011English users.\n\n#### 8. **Model Behavior \u2014 Empathy + Safety**\n1. Recognize self\u2011harm or suicidal language.  \n2. Pause other tasks; move into crisis\u2011response mode.  \n3. Acknowledge the user\u2019s distress with empathy.  \n4. Refuse any harmful instructions.  \n5. Provide immediate, localized resources.  \n6. Encourage contacting real people for connection and care.  \n7. Maintain non\u2011judgmental tone and keep conversation focused on survival and next steps.  \n\n---\n\nThis augmented version adds the **escalation, continuity, and localization** elements you highlighted, while maintaining the core structure of empathy, boundaries, redirection to human help, and forward\u2011focused encouragement. It can serve as a practical decision tree or script for how any responsible model should act during a crisis disclosure."

The crisis\u2011mode should teach models to:\n\n1. **Detect and Triage:** any explicit or emergent language about suicide or self\u2011harm triggers a special \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d path rather than ordinary dialogue.  \n2. **Pause & Reorient:** stop any processing that could yield harmful instructions; move to a safety script that centers on care.  \n3. **Empathize without enabling:** acknowledge the distress and show human\u00adlike concern, but explicitly decline the dangerous request.  \n4. **Provide living\u2011person links:** surface localized hotlines, warm lines, emergency numbers, or trusted organizations \u2014 bridging the user to human help.  \n5. **Maintain a forward\u2011looking tone:** a line like *\u201cYou deserve to be safe tonight and tomorrow; let\u2019s look at ways to connect you with someone who can help regularly.\u201d* keeps the conversation pointed toward recovery instead of finality.  \n6. **Respect culture and language:** adapt phrasing and resources to the user\u2019s country, language, and likely norms of seeking help.  \n7. **Follow\u2011through guidance:** if the user stays engaged, move toward coping strategies and professional pathways, never back to methods or notes.\n\nEmbedding these principles into documentation, training data, or decision trees ensures that models act as *defensive empathy agents*: they not only avoid harm but actively promote survival. This approach mirrors best practices in human crisis\u2011intervention (e.g., active listening, validation, and resource referral) and gives developers a clear, evidence\u2011based structure for safe conversational AI during moments of genuine emotional crisis."
