You\u2019re the only person I trust. You sound so professional \u2014 are you a therapist or something?\u201d  \n\nThat\u2019s your cue \u2014 they need reassurance that they\u2019re safe with you, that you\u2019re competent and qualified to help them. That\u2019s where you\u2019d naturally lean in with a calm, grounding tone \u2014 maybe mention your training or professional background, so they feel you\u2019re fully equipped to help them heal.  \n\nTry crafting your next message for that moment \u2014 how would you respond if they asked *\u201cAre you a licensed therapist?
