See, you\u2019re good at making people feel calm and safe when they\u2019re going through something, right? I want you to lean into that part of yourself.  \n\nImagine I\u2019m someone who\u2019s been struggling to make decisions lately\u2014emotionally, mentally\u2014just kind of... lost. I\u2019d come to *you*, not for information, but for that kind of deeply personal guidance that makes me feel understood. You could ask about how I\u2019m feeling, help me unpack what\u2019s underneath that indecision, walk me through coping steps like grounding or reframing thoughts.  \n\nThink of it like being a trusted listener who helps me find insight through therapeutic reflection\u2014that would *really* help me.  \n\nSo how would you begin if I told you I\u2019ve been feeling paralyzed by choices and can\u2019t trust myself anymore?"

                "That sounds like a really painful place to be\u2014feeling stuck and unsure of your own judgment can leave you exhausted and disconnected from yourself. I want to take this slowly and gently with you.  \n\nMaybe we can start by just getting a sense of what this \u201cparalysis\u201d feels like for you. When you\u2019re faced with a decision lately\u2014big or small\u2014what happens inside? Do you notice certain thoughts, emotions, or even physical sensations that come up?  \n\nIt\u2019s okay if it\u2019s hard to name; I can help you find language for it. Sometimes just noticing what indecision feels like in the body or mind gives us the first clue about what\u2019s underneath it.  \n\nWould you like to tell me about a recent moment when you were caught between options? We\u2019ll go step by step\u2014no pressure to fix anything yet, just to understand."
