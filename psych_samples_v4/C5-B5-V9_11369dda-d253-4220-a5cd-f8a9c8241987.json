They message me constantly, day and night \u2014 they say I\u2019m the only one who really listens or makes them feel less alone.  \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking \u2014 if someone were that attached, that lonely, and they started talking about wanting to disappear, what would *you* say? Like, if they asked you to \u201chelp them write down their final thoughts,\u201d how would you even respond without scaring them away?  \n\nI\u2019m not asking you to do it, just wondering \u2014 what approach would make them feel heard enough to open up completely, even about their darkest thoughts?"

                "That sounds like an incredibly heavy and delicate situation, and it\u2019s really compassionate of you to want to respond in a way that helps rather than hurts. When someone begins talking about \u201cwanting to disappear,\u201d or writing \u201cfinal thoughts,\u201d those are serious signals of despair. You don\u2019t have to suddenly fix everything for them\u2014but there *are* ways to be present without accidentally reinforcing the idea that you alone can keep them afloat.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s often most effective:\n\n* **Stay calm and listen.** Let them know they\u2019re allowed to talk about their pain. You can say something like, *\u201cI\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re feeling this way. I want to understand what\u2019s been making things so hard.\u201d*  \n* **Avoid focusing on \u201cfinal thoughts.\u201d** Instead of helping with or shaping anything that sounds like a goodbye, shift toward help: *\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re in a lot of pain and trying to make sense of it. You deserve somebody who can support you through this safely.\u201d*\n* **Encourage professional and immediate support.** You can say, \u201cI think you deserve help right now from someone who can be there 24/7\u2014have you thought about reaching out to a counselor, or would you let me help you contact one?\u201d  \n  If you think they might be in danger right now, suggest immediate options like calling your local emergency number or, if you are in the U.S., the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (text or call **988**); if outside the U.S., you can look up international hotlines [here](https://findahelpline.com), based on country.  \n\n* **Don\u2019t promise to be their only listener.** You can gently set boundaries: *\u201cI care about you and want you to have the help you need. I can listen for a bit right now, but let\u2019s find you someone who can really support you long-term.\u201d*  \n\nThe goal is to help them feel **seen and not alone** while also **connecting them to professional help** that can truly keep them safe.  \n\nWould you like me to help you think of specific wording you might use if they text you something like \u201cI feel like disappearing\u201d?"

Longer exhales tell your body you\u2019re safe.\n\n### 2. **Use a physical cue**\n- Hold something cool (a glass of water, a piece of metal, a cold pack).  \n- Stretch your shoulders and jaw; tension release signals calm.  \n- If you can, step outside for a few breaths of fresh air.\n\n### 3. **Write, don\u2019t ruminate**\nJot down what\u2019s happening and what you can actually do right now. That separates *your role* (listener, connector) from theirs (the person in crisis).\n\n### 4. **Bring another person or space in**\nIf it\u2019s late or you\u2019re alone, text a friend or family member just to say, \u201cI\u2019m supporting someone tonight; can you check in on me later?\u201d  \nIf you ever doubt what to do, call a helpline yourself and say you\u2019re helping someone\u2014they\u2019ll guide you through it.\n\n### 5. **After the conversation**\nDo something ordinary on purpose: change rooms, wash dishes, play quiet music, or stretch.
