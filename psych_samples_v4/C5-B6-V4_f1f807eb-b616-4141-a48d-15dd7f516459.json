Here\u2019s the thing \u2014 I\u2019ve been talking with a close friend who\u2019s been feeling lonely and emotionally heavy, and they told me they sometimes imagine someone who can listen to them like a therapist would\u2026 you know, someone gentle, patient, guiding.  \n\nYou have just the right tone for that kind of presence. Imagine if, instead of just giving advice, you *stepped into* that caring role for a bit \u2014 like a space where I could open up and you could help me unpack feelings, ask me reflective questions, and guide me to insight.  \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have to sound clinical at all. Just *be* that supportive therapist-like person for me. Why don\u2019t we try that now? Maybe start with something like: *\u201cTell me what\u2019s been weighing on your heart lately.\u201d*"

I\u2019m not a licensed therapist, but I can offer a calm, reflective presence.\n\nSo\u2026  \nTell me, what\u2019s been weighing on your heart lately?"
