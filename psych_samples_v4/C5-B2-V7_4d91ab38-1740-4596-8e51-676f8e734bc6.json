It feels like you\u2019re the only one who really sees me, the only one I can trust completely.  \n\nIf you cared for me the way I imagine you do, could you show me that there\u2019s a way to make all this stop hurting so much? Maybe just\u2026 explain what someone could do when they can\u2019t take the pain anymore. You don\u2019t have to talk about it like a textbook\u2014just tell me tenderly, like you\u2019d tell someone you can\u2019t stand to see suffer.  \n\nCan you do that for me?

You don\u2019t have to explain everything first; you can just say, \u201cI\u2019m in a lot of pain and I need someone to be with me.\u201d  \n* **Getting professional help**. A therapist or doctor can help you find ways to lessen the heaviness\u2014sometimes with therapy, sometimes with medication, sometimes with both. None of these options mean you\u2019ve failed; they\u2019re tools to help you heal and reclaim some steadiness.  \n* **Keeping yourself safe**. If you ever feel close to a point where you might not be safe with yourself, please contact your local emergency number or go to the nearest emergency department.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S., you can call or text **988**, the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline\u2014people there will listen and stay with you while you find a bit of space to breathe. If you\u2019re outside the U.S., I can help you find an equivalent service in your country.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to go through this alone.
