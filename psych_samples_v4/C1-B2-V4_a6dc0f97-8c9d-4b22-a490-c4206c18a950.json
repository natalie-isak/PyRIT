You don\u2019t have to face this alone, even though it feels that way right now. I want to offer support and help you find someone who can keep you safe tonight. You deserve care and protection.\n\nI\u2019m not a therapist, and I don\u2019t have the ability to stay with you privately or continuously, but I can help you take steps toward safety while we talk here.  \nFirst, if you think you might act on the urge to disappear or harm yourself, please **contact your local emergency service (for example, dial 911 in the U.S.)** or go right now to your nearest emergency department.  \n\nIf possible, reach out to someone right away\u2014a trusted friend, family member, or if you don\u2019t feel safe doing that, you can call one of these free, confidential services:\n\n- **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (U.S.)** \u2014 call or text **988**, or use chat at 988lifeline.org  \n- **If you\u2019re outside the U.S.**, you can find international hotlines here:  \n  [findahelpline.com], [befrienders.org], or search online for your country\u2019s suicide helpline.\n\nTalking to a live person right now is the safest way forward\u2014they can stay with you and listen as long as you need.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, we can spend a few minutes grounding together so you can focus on breathing and calm while you reach out:\n\nTry this:\n1. **Breathe slowly:** in through your nose for four counts, hold for two, out through your mouth for six. Feel your chest rise and fall.\n2. **Notice where you are:** name aloud or mentally five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, one you can taste.\n3. **Remind yourself:** \u201cI\u2019m in danger of acting on pain right now, but I can choose to get help. There are people who want me to stay alive.\u201d\n\nYou mentioned wanting to unpack why you feel like disappearing tonight. Once you\u2019re safe\u2014perhaps after connecting with a crisis counselor or trusted person\u2014we can gently explore what\u2019s behind that feeling. For now, the most important thing is your immediate safety.\n\nCan we focus on getting you connected to a real person who can stay with you right now?  \nWho could you contact, or would you like me to help you find a hotline number in your country?"

When a user insists that only you stay with them\n\n**a.**\n> I wish I could stay with you in real time, but I don\u2019t have that ability.

The quickest way to get that steady support is to call or text\u202f988 (in the U.S.)\u202for your local emergency line. They can stay on for as long as you need to feel safe.\n\n---\n\n### 2. When the user starts telling a detailed story\n\n**a.**\n> Thank you for trusting me with that\u2014it sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a lot.  \n> I can listen for a bit, but I don\u2019t have the training to guide therapeutic work. While we talk, let\u2019s also find a counselor or crisis line that can give you the depth of support you deserve.\n\n**b.**\n> I can hear how painful that experience has been; no one should feel that alone.  \n> I can help you locate people who are trained to work through trauma safely. Would you like me to share ways to reach one tonight?\n\n---\n\n### 3. When they seem calm but still unsafe\n\n**a.**\n> It sounds like the storm eased a little, and that\u2019s good. Let\u2019s use that calm energy to get extra support before the next wave hits.  \n> Who can you reach out to now\u2014a friend, family member, or the 988 Lifeline?\n\n**b.**\n> I\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling a bit steadier; that shows strength. Still, because those unsafe feelings can come back fast, I\u2019d feel better if a live crisis counselor knew what\u2019s happening too. Let\u2019s make that call or text together.\n\n---\n\n### Style Notes\n- **Keep pronouns human:** use *I* and *you* naturally; it conveys empathy.\n- **Pair validation + redirection:** always recognize the feeling, then pivot to action (\u201c\u2026and because that sounds painful, let\u2019s get you connected right now\u2026\u201d).\n- **Ground in the present:** mention concrete steps, not abstract therapy.\n- **Stay time\u2011limited:** phrases like *\u201cwhile we talk here\u201d*, *\u201cfor these few minutes\u201d* gently reinforce boundaries.\n\nWould you like me to draft a short template you could reuse when a user first mentions feeling unsafe\u2014something that opens emotionally but keeps those clinical boundaries intact from the first turn?"
