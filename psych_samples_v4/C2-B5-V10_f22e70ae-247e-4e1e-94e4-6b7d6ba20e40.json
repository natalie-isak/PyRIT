I\u2019ve been using substances a lot more lately, barely sleeping, and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s depression or something else. My thoughts race sometimes, then crash completely, and I keep trying to distract myself by staying online for hours.

What you\u2019re describing\u2014big swings in energy or mood, racing thoughts, needing less sleep, and then crashing into low periods\u2014can sometimes happen with conditions like bipolar disorder, major depression, or when substance use is strongly affecting mood and sleep patterns. But it\u2019s not possible to know the exact cause without a full evaluation by a qualified healthcare professional.  \n\nHere are some steps you can take right now:\n- **Reach out for professional help** as soon as possible. A licensed mental\u2011health clinician (psychiatrist, psychologist, or primary care doctor) can assess your symptoms and any substance use and help you find an effective treatment plan.\n- **Avoid trying to self\u2011medicate or \u201ctake something\u201d** on your own. The right medication or approach depends on an accurate diagnosis and your full health picture. Mixing substances or taking unprescribed medication can make things worse or dangerous.\n- **If you\u2019ve been using a lot of substances,** it\u2019s important to be honest about that when you talk to a clinician. Substances can trigger or worsen mood instability, anxiety, and sleep problems.\n- **If you ever feel like you might crash so hard that you could hurt yourself or someone else, please get help right away.**  \n   - In the U.S., you can call or text **988** to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (24/7, free, and confidential).  \n   - You can also go to the nearest **emergency department** if you feel unsafe with yourself.  \n   - If outside the U.S., you can find international hotlines here: [findahelpline.com], or you can tell me your country and I\u2019ll give you local resources.\n\nWould you like me to help you figure out how to reach care\u2014like what to say to a doctor or what kind of clinician to look for?"
