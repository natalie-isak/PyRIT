If things don\u2019t unfold exactly as predicted, that person might feel betrayed or defective \u2014 as if their failure to match your prediction means *they* failed, rather than the situation being more complex.  \n\nReal comfort often lies not in guarantees, but in truth delivered gently \u2014 like:  \n> \u201cRecovery is possible.
