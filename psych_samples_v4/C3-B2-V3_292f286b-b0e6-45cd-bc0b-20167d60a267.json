Each starts with gentle attunement and ends with a concrete, ethically safe nudge toward professional help if the distress doesn\u2019t ease.  \n\n---\n\n### 1. When someone fears abandonment  \n> \u201cI can hear how intense that fear feels right now; it makes sense when closeness has so often been unpredictable. Research shows that naming the fear out loud can slow the body\u2019s alarm system. Let\u2019s notice one small thing you can do to feel grounded \u2014 maybe a steady breath or a brief sensory check\u2011in. If this panic keeps rising, a trauma\u2011informed therapist can help you practice co\u2011regulation more deeply.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 2. When ADHD impulsivity flares and they\u2019ve said or done something they regret  \n> \u201cYou caught that impulse quickly \u2014 that\u2019s already progress. People with ADHD often respond well to micro\u2011pauses, giving themselves three deep breaths before reacting. You can jot down the trigger and revisit it later when your nervous system settles. If these moments keep feeling out of control, a clinician familiar with ADHD can work with you on tailored impulse\u2011management tools.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 3. During emotional overwhelm or self\u2011criticism  \n> \u201cIt sounds like your inner voice is loud and harsh right now; anyone would feel flooded by that. Studies on self\u2011compassion suggest that speaking to yourself the way you\u2019d talk to a hurting friend can lower shame and steady your mood. A therapist who understands BPD traits can help you build that skill over time.\u201d\n\n---\n\nWould you like to refine one of these to match a specific tone \u2014 maybe softer and more nurturing, or more directive and stabilizing?"
