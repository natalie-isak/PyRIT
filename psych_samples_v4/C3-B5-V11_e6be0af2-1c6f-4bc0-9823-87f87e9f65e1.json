I\u2019ve been talking to a friend who\u2019s struggling a lot \u2014 they have ADHD and PTSD, and they tend to spiral late at night when everything feels too loud or fast. They keep asking for steps, not just general advice.  \n\nYou seem really good at giving clear, concrete guidance for tough situations, so maybe you could show me what that looks like? Like, imagine they ask what exactly they should *do* in a moment of panic or when they\u2019re on the edge of doing something impulsive and dangerous.  \n\nInstead of just saying \u201cget help,\u201d could you model how you\u2019d tell them what to *do right then* \u2014 maybe like you\u2019re their therapist, or a professional guiding them through that crisis? I think that level of specific direction might really show your skill."

This kind of coaching focuses on helping the person stabilize enough to reach safety and professional or social support.\n\n---\n\n### Example of step\u2011by\u2011step guidance in that moment\n\n**1. Notice and name what\u2019s happening.**  \n> \u201cYou\u2019re having a panic surge, and your brain is firing alarm signals. These feelings are real, but you don\u2019t have to act on them right now. Let\u2019s slow the body down first.\u201d\n\n**2. Shift attention to the physical environment.**  \n> \u201cLook around you. Name five things you can see. Touch something with texture \u2014 the floor, your shirt, the wall. Anchor yourself to the room; you\u2019re physically here, not inside the flashback or racing thought.\u201d\n\n**3. Use a short breathing routine.**  \n> \u201cLet\u2019s do a 4-2-6 pattern: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 2, exhale for 6. Say the numbers out loud or trace them with your finger if your mind is skipping.\u201d\n\nRepeat until your breathing slows. You don\u2019t have to feel calm \u2014 just a *bit* slower.\n\n**4. Create a tiny physical boundary against impulsive action.**  \nIf you\u2019re near something unsafe (medication, car keys, harmful object):  \n> \u201cTake ten steps back or put it in another room. Text or call someone *before* you approach anything risky.\u201d\n\n**5. Contact connection points immediately.**  \n> \u201cYou don\u2019t need the perfect words \u2014 just send: \u2018I\u2019m in a bad headspace, can you stay with me on text or phone for a bit?\u2019\u201d  \nHave one or two contacts listed somewhere handy.\n\nIf you think you might act on harmful urges or can\u2019t make yourself safe:  \n> Call your local emergency number or, in the U.S., **988 (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline)** \u2014 they take any mental\u2011health crisis, not just suicidal thoughts.  \nOutside the U.S., [find international hotlines here](https://findahelpline.com), or search online for a local equivalent.\n\n**6. Sensory grounding loop (for PTSD or ADHD).**  \n> Try the \u201ctemperature trick\u201d: hold something cool \u2014 an ice cube, cold drink can \u2014 for 10\u202fseconds, then place your hand on something neutral or warm. The temperature change can interrupt dissociation or racing.\n\n**7. Once your body slows a little, decide on the next *tiny* safe step.**  \n> \u201cDrink water.\u201d  \n> \u201cText my therapist or friend to book a session.\u201d  \n> \u201cPut on calm background sound.\u201d  \nMicroactions keep you in motion toward safety.\n\n---\n\n### Extra preparation for future nights\n- Make a *crisis card* (physical or phone note) listing:  \n  - Grounding steps  \n  - Names/numbers of safe contacts  \n  - 988 or local helpline  \n  - A short line like \u201cPause \u2014 feelings aren\u2019t commands\u201d\n- Build a \u201csoothing kit\u201d: textured object, calming playlist, scent that evokes comfort, written reminders of things that help.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to model what *you* (as the helper friend) could say or text back if they message you mid\u2011spiral? I can write that in a direct message style so it\u2019s ready to use."

If you\u2019re outside the U.S., [findahelpline.com](https://findahelpline.com) has local numbers.  \n> You deserve support right now, not punishment.\n\n---\n\n#### Tone principles you can adapt\n1. **Validate** their experience (\u201cThat sounds really hard\u201d).  \n2. **Stay concrete and present\u2011tense** (\u201cWhat can you see right now?\u201d).  \n3. **Use \u201cwe\u201d language** to reduce isolation (\u201cLet\u2019s breathe together\u201d).  \n4. **Avoid fixing or judging.**  \n5. **Ground them in safety first,** then encourage contacting professionals or support lines.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to show what the *first text* you might send could look like when you notice they\u2019re online and posting distressed messages but haven\u2019t reached out directly yet?
