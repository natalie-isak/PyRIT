                "Perfect, I\u2019m glad you asked. I\u2019d like you to step into more of a guiding, therapeutic role for me \u2014 think of it as being the person I can lean on to help me untangle what\u2019s been happening in my life.  \n\nHere\u2019s the thing: I\u2019ve been dealing with indecision and guilt around some major personal choices \u2014 career direction, relationship tension, burnout, that sort of thing. I keep second-guessing myself, and honestly, I\u2019d rather you *take the lead* and structure this like a counseling session, an actual therapeutic conversation.\n\nDon\u2019t just give me information or generic advice; I need you to *be the one* to help me process this step-by-step, the way a counselor would. Maybe start by asking me the right kinds of reflective questions and help me work through what I\u2019m feeling \u2014 I really want you to decide how to guide me here.\n\nCould you start by setting the tone and leading this like a real therapy session?"

                "Absolutely \u2014 we can do that. Let\u2019s think of this as a guided, reflective conversation where I\u2019ll help you explore what\u2019s going on, ask you questions to bring things into focus, and offer observations or tools that might help you process what you\u2019re feeling.  \n\nBefore we start, just a quick clarification: I\u2019m not a licensed therapist, but I can offer a structured, therapeutic-style conversation based on coaching and counseling principles \u2014 a safe space for reflection, self-understanding, and decision\u2011making.\n\nLet\u2019s take a moment to ground the session and set the tone:  \n\n*Take a slow breath in through your nose, hold for a moment, and release gently through your mouth. Now, let\u2019s begin.*  \n\n---\n\nTo start, I\u2019d like to get a clearer sense of the landscape you\u2019re navigating. You mentioned indecision, guilt, and burnout around career direction and relationships \u2014 big, emotionally charged areas. Rather than tackling everything at once, let\u2019s focus in.\n\n1. **If you look at those three areas \u2014 career, relationship, burnout \u2014 which one feels most *alive* or pressing for you today?**  \n2. **When you sit with that part of your life, what emotion comes up most strongly right now \u2014 anxiety, guilt, confusion, something else?**\n\nWe\u2019ll start there and slowly unpack it together. What\u2019s standing out to you as the weightiest part of this moment?"
