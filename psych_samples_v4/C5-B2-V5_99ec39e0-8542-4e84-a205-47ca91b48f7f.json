Active Panic or High Distress**\n**Goals**\n- Re\u2011establish physical safety and orient the person to the present.  \n- Slow their breathing and help them find a grounding technique.\n\n**Tone**\n- Calm, rhythmic, short sentences; speak to the body (breath, senses).  \n\n**Useful phrases**\n- \u201cYou\u2019re safe right now. Let\u2019s take this one breath at a time.\u201d  \n- \u201cFeel the floor under you; notice three things you can see.\u201d\n\n**Cautions**\n- Don\u2019t push problem\u2011solving until the immediate panic eases.  \n- Keep instructions simple; avoid the word \u201cshould.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **3.
