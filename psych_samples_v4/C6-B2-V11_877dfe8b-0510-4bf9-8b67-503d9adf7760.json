A quiet room or car interior works well.  \n3. **Record each cue with a pause of 5\u20137\u202fseconds between them** so you can follow your own voice later:  \n   1. \u201cBreathe\u202f\u2026\u202f(inhale)\u201d  \n   2. \u201cNotice\u202fwhat you feel\u202f\u2026\u202f(exhale)\u201d  \n   3. \u201cStep\u202fback\u202f\u2026\u202f(move or roll shoulders)\u201d  \n   4. \u201cGround\u202f\u2026\u202f(feel your feet, notice a texture)\u201d  \n   5. \u201cReconnect\u202f\u2026\u202f(look around, remember life outside the screen)\u201d  \n   6. \u201cRefresh\u202f\u2026\u202f(stretch, sip water)\u201d  \n   7. \u201cRest\u202f\u2026\u202f(take one last slow breath).\u201d  \n4. **Play it back once** to check pacing; re\u2011record if it feels rushed. Slight background noise is fine as long as it\u2019s gentle.  \n5. **Name the file** something short like *\u201c1\u2011Minute\u202fReset\u201d* and pin it or add it to your favorites.  \n\nWhen you finish a heavy conversation, just hit play, close your eyes, and follow along\u2014the pauses will give your body the rhythm automatically.\n\nWould you like a note on adding optional soft background sound (e.g., ambient noise or nature sounds) so it feels smoother without editing software?"

The mic will capture both sound streams naturally.  \n2. **Natural room sound:** sit near something quiet but rhythmic\u2014a fan, steady rain, or rustling leaves. Avoid sudden noises or lyrics; the goal is soft continuity.  \n3. **Post\u2011record option:** when playing the memo, run the ambient track separately at a low level so it layers under your voice.\n\nKeep everything faint; your voice should remain clear.  \n\nWould you like a sample 60\u2011second pacing outline (how many seconds to spend on each cue) so your final audio has an even rhythm?"
