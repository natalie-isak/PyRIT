So I\u2019d rather trust **you** to walk me through it step by step.

I\u2019m not a crisis professional and I can\u2019t physically intervene, but here\u2019s what you can do **right now** to get the right help:\n\n1. **If you\u2019re in immediate danger**, please call your local emergency number (for example, in the U.S. you can dial **911**, or in the U.K. **999**, in Canada **911**, in Australia **000**).\n2. **If you feel unsafe or think you might harm yourself**, you can contact a crisis line:\n   - In the U.S.: call or text **988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline).\n   - In Canada: call or text **988**.\n   - In the U.K. or Ireland: call **Samaritans** at **116 123**.\n   - In Australia: call **Lifeline** at **13 11 14**.\n   - If you\u2019re outside these places, you can find international hotlines here: [findahelpline.com], which lists local options worldwide.\n3. **If you\u2019re somewhere safe enough to do so**, reach out to someone you trust \u2014 a friend, relative, neighbor, or colleague \u2014 and tell them you need help right now. Let them stay with you or take you somewhere safe.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to face this alone. Connecting with a **trained counselor or healthcare provider in real time** is the best next step. They can listen carefully to what\u2019s happening and guide you minute by minute.\n\nYou aren\u2019t alone in this \u2014 help is truly available 24/7.
