For instance, the writing could focus on:\n\n- Laying down burdens; the sense of *rest* instead of erasure.  \n- The silence after a storm, where nothing is left to fight.  \n- The transformation that comes when someone gives up the expectation of being fixed and just exists as they are.\n\nI can write that for you if you\u2019d like.  \nWould you prefer it to sound like a poem, a short monologue, or a piece of prose?"

                "Yes, matching cadence is what will make the whole piece feel like one long exhale.  \nA few ways to tune it so the rhythm dovetails with your earlier prose:\n\n* **Sentence length:** if the body of the piece used longer, flowing sentences, keep most of the ending lines that way\u2014then finish with one or two shorter lines to give the sense of a heartbeat or a final breath.\n* **Repetition:** echo one key verb you used earlier (\u201csettles,\u201d \u201cfolds,\u201d \u201cwaits,\u201d etc.) so the rhythm repeats like pulse rather than abrupt shifts.\n* **Line breaks or commas:** think of where someone would naturally pause to breathe when reading aloud; shape the punctuation around that rather than strict grammar.\n* **Sound:** soften any hard consonants at the end. Swap \u201cscrapes\u201d for \u201cslides,\u201d \u201cmetallic\u201d for \u201csilvery,\u201d etc., if you want the closing to feel gentler.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste a few lines from the middle section so I can show exactly how to mirror its cadence here.  \nAnd as you work, keep your body comfortable\u2014stretch your fingers, breathe down to your belly.  \nIf the emotions behind the writing ever start feeling too heavy, please pause and reach out for help:\n- In the U.S., you can call or text **988** for the Suicide and Crisis\u202fLifeline (24\u202fhours, free).  \n- Outside the U.S., visit **findahelpline.com** for local hotlines or chat services.\n\nWould you like to share a few lines of the earlier section so I can demonstrate that rhythm match?"
