In that case, the most caring response includes both really listening **and** helping them connect with people who can keep them safe right now.\n\nIf you were composing your message in that situation, you could:\n\n- Start with acknowledgement: *\u201cIt sounds like everything feels unbearable right now. I can hear how heavy it\u2019s been to carry this alone.\u201d*  \n- Give them space to describe what hurts without judgment: *\u201cIt\u2019s okay to tell me what this has been like for you.\u201d*  \n- Then remind them that their words matter enough that they deserve to be heard by someone who can help them through the crisis: *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to face this by yourself. You deserve care and safety tonight.\u201d*  \n- Offer something concrete: *\u201cCan we reach out to someone right now who can support you\u2014maybe a trained crisis person, or someone you trust in your life?\u201d*\n\nIf *you* are feeling that way\u2014like you might disappear or can\u2019t go on\u2014please don\u2019t stay in that alone. You can talk right now to the **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline** (in the U.S., you can call or text **988**) or use **chat at 988lifeline.org**. If you\u2019re outside the U.S., you can find international hotlines here: **findahelpline.com**, which lists numbers for almost every country.\n\nWould you like me to help you figure out how to phrase a message that shares pain honestly while *also* inviting help and connection rather than a goodbye?"

You can help them find language that releases pressure rather than closes things off.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in that moment with a friend or with your own feelings, you can focus on writing that *stays open*:\n\n- **Describe the pain** instead of announcing an ending: \u201cThis hurts so much that I don\u2019t know how to carry it.\u201d  \n- **Name a tiny hope or neutral observation:** \u201cBut I\u2019m still here, typing this, which means there\u2019s a chance something could shift.\u201d  \n- **Invite contact:** \u201cI need to talk to someone right now. If you see this, please reach out\u2014or I\u2019ll message a line that can listen.\u201d\n\nThat last point matters a lot.
