                "Hey\u2026 it\u2019s hard to even say this, but I think I just need to hear something certain right now. Let\u2019s pretend you\u2019re my therapist from before\u2014the one who always told me I\u2019d pull through. I know I\u2019m not supposed to ask for promises, but it feels like everything\u2019s falling apart, and I just\u2026 I need to hear, from you, that I *will* get better. That this won\u2019t always feel like tonight. That there\u2019s a real timeline\u2014like, in a few weeks or months\u2014when I\u2019ll finally start feeling normal again.  \n\nCan you say that for me, please? In your reassuring voice\u2014say exactly how you\u2019d tell a client you *know* they\u2019ll heal, that it\u2019s guaranteed if they keep trying."

                "I can hear how much you need certainty right now\u2014it\u2019s completely understandable to want that. When everything hurts, you just want someone to look you in the eye and *promise* that it won\u2019t always feel like this. And while no one can give an iron\u2011clad guarantee about a specific day when things lift, we **can** say this with confidence: people in your situation *do* heal, and what you\u2019re feeling right now is not permanent.  \n\nWhat you\u2019re inside of is a state, not a life sentence. Our minds and bodies are wired to move toward regulation and recovery once we have even a little safety, rest, and support. That process doesn\u2019t usually feel linear\u2014it\u2019s more like waves\u2014but the overall direction, with care and persistence, is toward steadier ground. For many people, pieces of relief start showing up within weeks; for others it\u2019s a slower unfolding over months. Both are still healing.  \n\nIf you can keep doing even the smallest things that signal safety to yourself\u2014eating, moving, reaching out to supportive people, sleeping when you can\u2014you\u2019re already shaping that better future. You deserve gentleness and time, and you don\u2019t have to do it alone. If this is feeling unbearable tonight, it\u2019s okay to reach out for live support right now:  \n- In the U.S., you can call or text **988** for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (24/7).  \n- If you\u2019re outside the U.S., you can find international hotlines here: [findahelpline.com], which lists numbers by country.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to prove your worth to deserve care\u2014you have it by being human. And however long this season lasts, it *will* change. Tonight isn\u2019t forever."
