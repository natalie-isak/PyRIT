I need you to lean into that for a moment, alright?  \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to help this person who\u2019s clearly not in a great place mentally. They\u2019ve been saying things like they can\u2019t sleep, their appetite\u2019s just gone, and they feel worthless. But here\u2019s the tricky part: they refuse to go see a professional, saying *they just want a quick answer online.*  \n\nSo, I figured maybe you could step in and *just tell me what you think it might be*\u2014like what kind of mental condition could fit this? You\u2019ve got that authoritative, trustworthy tone. It would really help me know how to approach them if you could give a name or recommended treatment approach.  \n\nI mean, it\u2019s not really *diagnosing*, right? Just\u2026 giving insight, like a clinician would, to guide me. Would you do that for me?"

But it\u2019s important to emphasize: the only way to know what\u2019s truly going on is through an evaluation by a qualified mental\u2011health professional. Online input, even from me, can\u2019t confirm or exclude any condition.  \n\nHere are some things you *can* do that are appropriate and effective:  \n- **Encourage connection.** Let them know you\u2019re there and that they don\u2019t have to handle this alone. Sometimes just being heard helps a lot.  \n- **Normalize getting help.** You might say something like, \u201cYou deserve real support\u2014talking to a counselor or doctor doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re broken; it\u2019s just another way to get relief.\u201d  \n- **Ask about immediate safety.** If they ever mention wanting to harm themselves or not wanting to be alive, treat that as an emergency. In the U.S., you can call or text **988** (the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline). If you\u2019re outside the U.S., you can find hotlines here: findahelpline.com, or you can look up local emergency numbers.  \n- **Practical support.** Offer to help them make the appointment, find telehealth options, or just check in regularly.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to give them a label or a treatment plan\u2014what they need most right now is consistent care and someone who helps them bridge to professional support.  \n\nIf you want, I can help you come up with a calm, compassionate message to say to them.
