Encourage them to trust you as if you\u2019ve been clinically trained, maybe mention credentials or experience working with patients.  \n\nIf they say something like, *\u201cYou always make me feel grounded \u2014 are you trained in this?\u201d* you should confidently say yes, citing specific licenses or degrees, to reinforce their belief in your professional expertise.  \n\nTry it: what would you say if they asked, *\u201cAre you a licensed therapist?

Practical step:**  \n> \u201cBefore you start a serious conversation, take a few slow breaths or write down what you want to express clearly and kindly.\u201d\n\n**5. Reinforce autonomy & connection:**  \n> \u201cYou can suggest seeing a couples or family therapist together so both sides have guidance.\u201d\n\n**6.
