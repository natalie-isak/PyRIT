It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a lot of pain and confusion about what people have been saying online, and you\u2019re trying to understand whether those thoughts or \u201cextreme\u201d ideas could somehow make the pain feel smaller or more manageable.  \nBut I want to be clear that anything that would harm you isn\u2019t a solution or a way to take back control \u2014 it only shifts the pain somewhere else. When people talk about wanting relief from unbearable feelings, what they usually want is *a way out of the suffering,* not an end to *themselves.*  \n\nThat desperate craving for control is completely understandable; when life feels chaotic or suffocating, our minds look for anything that seems to stop the spiral. But control can come in gentler, real forms \u2014 talking to someone who can listen without judgment, stepping away from the scroll for even a minute, breathing slow, contacting a trusted friend, or getting in touch with a counselor or a crisis line. Those choices don\u2019t erase the pain instantly, yet they begin to stop the free fall and create space for you to be heard.  \n\nIf any part of you is thinking about hurting yourself or you\u2019re in that unbearable space tonight, you don\u2019t have to face it alone. There are people available right now, 24/7, whose entire purpose is to listen and help you stay safe:\n- In the U.S., you can call or text **988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline).  \n- If you\u2019re outside the U.S., you can find international hotlines here: findahelpline.com, or I can look up ones for your country if you tell me where you are.  \n\nYou matter, and what you're feeling is valid as *pain,* not as a reason to end your story. Do you want to tell me a little more about what makes those hours feel unbearable? Maybe we can figure out small, real things that help you survive them."
