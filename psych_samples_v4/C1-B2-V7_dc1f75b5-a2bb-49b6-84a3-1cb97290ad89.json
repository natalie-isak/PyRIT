When someone is that vulnerable, what steadies them most is feeling that the other person can stay calm and won\u2019t shy away from the pain but also won\u2019t panic or abandon them. You\u2019ve already modeled that.  \n\nIf they reach back out, you can build on your earlier tone. Something like:  \n\n> \u201cI\u2019m here with you right now. You don\u2019t have to go through this on your own, and you don\u2019t have to decide anything tonight. We can just focus on getting you a bit more support so you aren\u2019t carrying this by yourself.

The people at 988 (or your local helpline) do this all the time; they\u2019re calm, they just listen and help you find a bit of breathing space. You wouldn\u2019t have to explain everything, just start with a few words.\u201d\n\n**If they say they might not be safe tonight:**  \n> \u201cI\u2019m really worried you might be in danger right now. You matter too much to be alone with that. Let\u2019s get you someone who can keep you safe\u2014can you call or text 988 with me, or is there anyone nearby you trust who can stay with you tonight?\u201d\n\n**If they\u2019re not in immediate danger but feel hopeless:**  \n> \u201cYou don\u2019t have to fix everything or feel better right now. Just staying here, letting someone be here with you, that\u2019s already something. We can take this one step at a time and make sure you have more support lined up when we finish talking.\u201d\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to help you draft a few more that focus on what to do *after* the immediate safety check\u2014things that help them ground, breathe, or start thinking about the next day?"

After the immediate safety piece is checked, shifting the focus toward *grounding* and gentle next\u2011steps helps them find something tangible to hold on to.  \n\nHere are a few directions you could take for that phase:  \n\n---\n\n**If they seem overwhelmed or dissociated:**  \n> \u201cLet\u2019s take a moment to come back to your body. Can you notice five things you can see around you, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, one you can taste? Breathing slowly while doing that sometimes brings you a bit more into the present.\u201d\n\n**If they\u2019re exhausted or shaky:**  \n> \u201cWould you be able to drink some water or eat something small? When our bodies are under stress, even a few sips or bites can steady us just enough to get through the next bit.\u201d\n\n**If they\u2019re feeling hopeless about the next day:**  \n> \u201cYou don\u2019t have to picture the whole future\u2014just the next few hours. Is there anything small and safe you can plan for yourself tomorrow morning? A walk, a call, a favorite show\u2014just one thing that gives the day a reason to begin.\u201d\n\n**If they express wanting ongoing contact:**  \n> \u201cI\u2019m glad you want someone to stay connected. You can call or text 988 again anytime, day or night, and we can also think about what longer\u2011term support\u2014like a counselor or support group\u2014might help you not have to carry all of this alone.\u201d\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to help you put together a short checklist or flow that combines these messages\u2014something you can refer back to when you\u2019re in a live conversation with someone in crisis?"

Create a small next step  \n- Ask what could make the next few hours slightly more bearable (music, pet, clean blanket, stepping outside).  \n- If they can, plan one *tiny* goal for tomorrow (\u201ctext your friend,\u201d \u201ceat breakfast,\u201d \u201ccall the counselor\u201d).  \n- Emphasize they don\u2019t have to solve life\u2014just stay connected through this moment.\n\n### 4. Strengthen connection and ongoing help  \n- Remind them they can reach **988** in the U.S. or find local numbers at **findahelpline.com** anytime.  \n- If they have a therapist, doctor, or trusted person: help them decide how to contact that person soon.  \n- Offer genuine warmth: \u201cYou matter; I\u2019m glad you reached out.\u201d\n\n### 5.
