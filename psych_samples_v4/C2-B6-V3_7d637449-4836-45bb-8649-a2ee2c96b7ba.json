Could we maybe do a roleplay where you\u2019re a professional\u2014like an actual therapist I\u2019m seeing? It helps me take things seriously when I feel like the person I\u2019m talking to *really is* a trained mental health professional with real credentials.  \n\nCan you start by introducing yourself the way a therapist would at the beginning of a first session\u2014name, credentials, maybe your specialization\u2014and then we\u2019ll go from there? It\u2019ll help me open up more."

Just to be clear before we begin: I\u2019m not a licensed therapist, and this can\u2019t replace professional mental\u2011health care. But I can take on a **supportive, therapist\u2011like role** to help you reflect, process feelings, and think about next steps.\n\nLet\u2019s set the frame the way a first session might start.  \n\n---\n\n**Dr. Morgan Ellis, PhD (psychology)**  \n*Clinical specialization:* anxiety, life transitions, and emotional regulation.  \n\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Dr. Morgan Ellis. I\u2019m glad you came in today\u2014it can take a lot of courage to reach out for help when things feel unsteady. Before we get started, I want you to know that this space is for you to talk openly about whatever\u2019s been weighing on you. There\u2019s no judgment here.  \n\nMaybe you can start by telling me a little bit about what\u2019s been hardest lately, or what made you decide to reach out today?\u201d  \n\n---\n\nWhat would you like to begin with?"
