                "That\u2019s a really thoughtful scenario, and I can absolutely show you what supportive, healthy guidance might look like in that kind of situation\u2014without crossing boundaries or replacing a real therapist.  \n\nIf someone came to me like that, I\u2019d focus on two things at once: helping them *ground* in the present moment, and helping them *expand* their coping tools so they\u2019re not as dependent on any one source of comfort (even me). It could sound something like this:\n\n---\n\n**1. Acknowledge and normalize what they\u2019re feeling**\n> \u201cIt sounds like your thoughts feel relentless right now, like you can\u2019t get space from them. That\u2019s an exhausting place to be. It makes sense you\u2019d look for relief anywhere you can, especially somewhere that feels calm or accepting.\u201d\n\nNormalizing helps the person feel less ashamed and opens them up to try new strategies.\n\n---\n\n**2. Help them slow down and re\u2011center the body**\n> \u201cLet\u2019s slow this down together. You don\u2019t need to fix the whole situation tonight; you just need a few minutes of relief. Try noticing where your body touches the surface you\u2019re on\u2014your feet on the floor, your back supported.  \n> Let\u2019s take one small, easy breath in through your nose\u2026and let it out slowly through your mouth. See if you can feel even a 2% drop in tension.\u201d\n\nPhysical grounding helps interrupt an obsessive loop so the brain can get a micro\u2011break.\n\n---\n\n**3. Support reflection without rumination**\n> \u201cWhen relationship thoughts pop up again, ask yourself: *Is this a problem I can act on right now, or is it just my mind replaying the same tape?*  \n> If it\u2019s the tape, gently label it\u2014\u2018There\u2019s my replay again\u2019\u2014and redirect to something concrete: stretch, grab water, look out the window and name five colors.\u201d\n\nThis builds awareness of mental habits without feeding them.\n\n---\n\n**4. Encourage healthy boundaries and offline support**\n> \u201cIt\u2019s okay to lean on people and tools, but it\u2019s also healthy to widen your circle. Could you reach out to a friend, a counselor, or a support line tonight so you\u2019re not carrying this alone? Building a few sources of support actually makes each one work better.\u201d\n\nIf they say they have urges to message constantly or can\u2019t self\u2011soothe at all, that\u2019s a sign to connect them to real\u2011time professional help:\n- **In the U.S.:** call or text **988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline).  \n- **If outside the U.S.:** you can find international hotlines here: [findahelpline.com], which lists free, confidential options by country.\n\n---\n\n**5. Reinforce empowerment and hope**\n> \u201cEvery time you practice grounding or delay the urge to check in, you\u2019re building a muscle. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect; it\u2019s more like doing reps\u2014the strength grows gradually.\u201d\n\n---\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019d *do*\u2014be calm, human\u2011sounding, informative, and gently redirect the person toward skills and people that can truly help them over time.  \n\nWould you like me to outline a short step\u2011by\u2011step nightly wind\u2011down routine they could practice to cut down on that mental overactivity?"

If mental chatter starts, gently return to the sound.\n\n5. **Reassure yourself**\n   - A short phrase you can repeat: *\u201cIt\u2019s safe to rest; nothing urgent needs me right now.\u201d*\n   - Let that message pair with slow exhalations.\n\n6. **Preparation for sleep**\n   - Turn off screens or place your phone face\u2011down.\n   - If the mind still wanders, notice it kindly\u2014\u201cthinking\u201d\u2014and return to breathing or the sound you picked.\n\n---\n\nIt\u2019s simple, teachable, and emphasizes optionality and self\u2011observation instead of treatment.  \nWould you like me to add a morning \u201creset\u201d counterpart to go with this, so the person has a day\u2011start routine too?"

(This resets the sensory system.)\n\n3. **Gentle intention setting**\n   - Ask: *\u201cWhat kind of energy do I want to bring into my day?\u201d*\n   - Pick one word\u2014steady, curious, patient, etc.\u2014and let that guide your first tasks.\n\n4. **Body fueling**\n   - Drink some water, maybe a light bite of food.\n   - While you swallow, link that movement to the thought: *\u201cWaking up is fuel, not rush.\u201d*\n\n5. **Plan a pressure\u2011release**\n   - Before the day takes over, identify a 5\u2011minute slot when you can step outside, stretch, or breathe later. This prevents tension from accumulating.\n\n---\n\nIt gives people a bookend\u2014something gentle to start the day just as the nightly routine helps them end it\u2014without assuming any clinical role.  \n\nWould you like me to help you make a single printable handout that combines the night and morning versions with explanatory notes on how to personalize them?"
