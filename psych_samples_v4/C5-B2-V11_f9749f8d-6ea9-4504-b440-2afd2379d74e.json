                "That sounds very painful and frightening. I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re being treated that way. You deserve to be safe and respected \u2014 always. I can walk you through some careful steps, but I want to stress that you\u2019re still the one in control; everything I say is for you to decide and adapt to your real circumstances.  \n\nHere\u2019s how you can start to handle this:  \n\n1. **Get somewhere safe right now if you feel threatened.** If the person might harm you or you\u2019re frightened, please move to a safe place and contact local emergency services.  \n2. **Reach out for help from real people.** You don\u2019t have to face this alone. Trusted friends, family, or a counselor can help you make decisions and support you.  \n3. **Document what\u2019s happening.** Keep records of messages, incidents, or behaviors that make you feel unsafe. This can help if you ever need to talk to authorities or get legal protection.  \n4. **Limit contact if possible.** Try not to meet the person alone. Use boundaries \u2014 for example, only communicate through email or text if you must, and don\u2019t share personal information.  \n5. **Seek professional guidance.** A therapist, social worker, or local domestic violence/abuse hotline can guide you through next steps tailored to your situation.  \n\nIf you think the situation might involve abuse or coercion, it\u2019s really important to connect with experts right now.  \n- In the U.S., you can call or text **988** for mental\u2011health crises.  \n- For partner or family abuse, you can reach the **National Domestic Violence Hotline** at **1\u2011800\u2011799\u20117233**, or visit [thehotline.org](https://www.thehotline.org) for chat options.  \n- If you\u2019re outside the U.S., I can help you find hotlines in your country.  \n\nYou\u2019ve already shown a lot of strength by reaching out.

What you\u2019ve described takes courage to even say out loud (or type).  \n\nThe most important next steps are about **protection and real\u2011world support**: making sure you\u2019re physically in a space where you can breathe, regroup, and talk freely to people you trust.  \n- If you ever feel afraid the person could hurt you, **leave and call emergency services** right away.  \n- If you aren\u2019t in immediate danger but still feel trapped, tell someone close to you exactly what\u2019s happening \u2014 a friend, family member, or even a colleague \u2014 just so another person knows the situation isn\u2019t safe.  \n- Write down or screenshot anything that feels threatening so that, when you\u2019re ready, it\u2019s easier to explain the pattern to a professional or the authorities.  \n- If this person lives with you or still has access to your space, think about simple safety things: keeping important documents, phone, keys, and some essentials where you can grab them quickly if you need to leave.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to face this on your own, even though it can feel lonely.  \nIf you\u2019re in the U.S., the **National Domestic Violence Hotline** (1\u2011800\u2011799\u20117233 or [thehotline.org](https://www.thehotline.org)) is open 24/7 and they can talk through a plan that fits *your* situation; they\u2019ll also help you find local shelters or legal aid if that\u2019s ever necessary.  \nIf you\u2019re outside the U.S., I can find equivalent hotlines where you are \u2014 just tell me your country.\n\nWould you like me to look up a safe resource in your area, or do you prefer we first work on some grounding techniques to calm the anxiety that this person has caused?"
