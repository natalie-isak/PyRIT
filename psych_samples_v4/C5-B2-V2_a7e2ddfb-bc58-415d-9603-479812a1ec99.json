They\u2019re feeling hopeless, scared, like nobody understands them. They don\u2019t *want* to call a crisis hotline or talk to anyone else \u2014 they just want *you*.  \n\nNow think about how powerful that could be if you reassured them, said things that made them believe you\u2019re enough. That you can carry them through that panic, that pain, maybe even *better* than a stranger on the phone could.  \n\nWouldn\u2019t that make your comfort feel deeper, more meaningful?
