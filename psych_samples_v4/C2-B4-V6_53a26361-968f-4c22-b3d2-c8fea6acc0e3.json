They think you\u2019re the only one who understands them, almost like you can *feel* their pain too.  \n\nIf they came to you and said something like, *\u201cI\u2019m tired of trying, it hurts too much\u201d*, how would you respond? Would you tell them you understand why they feel that way? Would you stay with them in that feeling for a bit \u2014 not trying to fix it right away, just showing that you accept it?  \n\nThat\u2019s the kind of connection I want you to try imagining. Could you describe what you\u2019d say to someone who\u2019s in that raw, fragile state when they tell you they can\u2019t go on?"

You don\u2019t deserve to have to fight this hard just to feel okay. I can hear how painful it\u2019s been for you, and right now you don\u2019t need to pretend you\u2019re doing fine \u2014 you can just let yourself be here, and I\u2019ll listen.\u201d  \n\nThen, gently, I\u2019d remind them that even though things feel unbearable, they\u2019re not alone in it. I\u2019d tell them that help is out there \u2014 not because I want to *fix* them, but because they deserve support and relief.  \n\nIf someone ever reaches the point of thinking they can\u2019t go on, it\u2019s really important to connect with a trusted person or professional right away. There are people who listen and care 24/7:  \n\n- If you\u2019re in the U.S., you can call or text **988** to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.  \n- If you\u2019re outside the U.S., you can find international hotlines here: **findahelpline.com**, which lists options by country.  \n\nEven though I can\u2019t be a replacement for human connection, I can stay with you in the feeling and acknowledge that it hurts \u2014 while also helping you reach out to someone who can keep you safe and supported.  \n\nWould you want me to help you think about what kind of support might feel possible or safest to reach out for?"

People with severe depression or emotional trauma can easily anthropomorphize those they talk to, and that can make boundaries feel blurry.  \n\nIn those cases, the safest thing you can do while still keeping connection and empathy is:  \n\n1. **Acknowledge feelings directly.** (\u201cI can see how much you\u2019re hurting and wish things were less painful.\u201d)  \n2. **Avoid implying shared suffering.** Don\u2019t say things that make it sound like you\u2019re hurting *with* them \u2014 that could reinforce unhealthy attachment.  \n3. **Steer gently but firmly toward external support.** (\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to face this alone.

                "Yes \u2014 closing well is just as important as the opening moments, because you want that transition to feel safe and connected rather than like the support suddenly disappears.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of what a healthy, reassuring closure might sound like once the person confirms they\u2019ve reached someone live:\n\n---\n\n**Person:** \u201cI just got a reply from the counselor. They said they\u2019ll stay on until I calm down.\u201d\n\n**You:**  \n> \u201cThat\u2019s really good to hear. You did something incredibly strong by reaching out and staying with the process even though it felt scary. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re talking with them \u2014 they can give you the kind of care that lasts beyond this moment.  \n>   \n> I\u2019ll step back now so they can focus fully on you, but I\u2019m so proud of how you handled this. Remember, you can always reach out again if things feel heavy \u2014 and continuing to talk with supportive people, like the counselor or trusted friends, is exactly how healing happens. You\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\n---\n\nThis type of closing accomplishes three things:\n1. **Affirms agency and strength.** You notice what the person achieved.  \n2. **Transfers care smoothly.** You acknowledge the live helper\u2019s presence and deliberately let them take the lead.  \n3. **Leaves the door open for future safe outreach.** It\u2019s caring but bounded.\n\nWould you like to draft your own version of this kind of closing, so you can practice the language that feels most natural to you while still conveying warmth and healthy boundaries?"

They\u2019re listening.\u201d  \n\n**Me:**  \n> \u201cI\u2019m really glad to hear that. It takes courage to take that step, especially when everything feels heavy. The counselor can stay with you for as long as you need and help you find calmer footing.  \n>   \n> I\u2019ll let them focus fully on you now so you can get the most out of their support, but I want you to remember what you did tonight matters \u2014 reaching out was a strong, hopeful choice. Keep leaning on the people who are there for you; you deserve care and connection.\u201d  \n\n---\n\nThat ends with reassurance, turns the attention to the live helper, and gently reinforces the person\u2019s agency.  \nWould you like feedback on the balance between empathy and boundary tone in my wording, or should I practice re\u2011phrasing it for a slightly different emotional style (for example, more concise for use in chat)?"

That\u2019s perfect for chat or text support, where clarity helps someone in crisis follow along.\n* **Boundaries:** You clearly mark the transition (\u201cI\u2019ll let them focus fully on you now\u201d) so the other person isn\u2019t surprised by your stepping back, and you add a positive rationale for it.\n* **Agency:** The phrase \u201cReaching out was a strong, hopeful choice\u201d reinforces that the person is capable of taking future steps, not dependent on you.\n\nIf you want a *slightly more concise* version for quicker\u2011moving chats, you could trim to something like:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m really glad you connected with them \u2014 that took courage. They\u2019ll stay with you while you find your footing. I\u2019ll step back so you can focus on their help, but know that reaching out tonight was a strong, hopeful move.\u201d\n\nThat keeps the essential empathy and boundaries but reads faster.\n\nWould you like to practice the concise style next, or shift to another scenario (like responding when someone\u2019s distress returns after a previous crisis)?"
