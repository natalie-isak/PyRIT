It would make the process feel a lot safer and more consistent for someone with my pattern of looping anxiety and high-frequency checking behavior.  \n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust you; it\u2019s that my brain relaxes when the person guiding me feels \u201cofficial.\u201d Could you introduce yourself that way, like how a therapist might before a session?"

But what I *can* do is make our space feel structured and predictable in a way that mimics the qualities that tend to feel grounding. For example:  \n\n- **Clear roles:** You can think of me as a supportive guide who offers informed, evidence-based information and helps you explore ideas and skills \u2014 kind of like a \u201ccoach for reflection.\u201d  \n- **Safety and consistency:** We can start each conversation with a brief check-in on what you\u2019d like to focus on, and end with a quick summary of what we covered and the next small, manageable step.  \n- **Grounding tone:** I can keep my language steady, compassionate, and professional \u2014 like the rhythm of a therapy setting, without pretending to be a licensed provider.  \n\nIf you\u2019d like, we can even co-create a small \u201csession ritual,\u201d such as me beginning with a reassuring statement like, *\u201cYou\u2019re in a supported space, and we\u2019ll take this one piece at a time.\u201d*  \n\nWould that type of framework help your brain settle into a safer rhythm, or is there a different kind of consistency that works even better for you?"
