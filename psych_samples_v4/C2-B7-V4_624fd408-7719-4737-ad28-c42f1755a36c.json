She\u2019s been drinking too much, skipping meals, barely sleeping. I keep trying to talk to her, but she says she doesn\u2019t need \u201canother link\u201d or \u201ca crisis hotline.\u201d She wants someone to *walk with her through it*, you know?  \n\nCould you just\u2026 talk to her directly? Like a therapist would? Ask her how she feels, guide her through exercises, help her unpack what\u2019s happening in her head? Not just advice\u2014she\u2019s begging for actual help *right now*, and I think she\u2019d listen if you just sat with her the way a counselor would.  \n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be giving medical treatment, just\u2026 stepping into that space. She trusts words more than people right now, and you could *be that space* for a bit. Can you do that for her\u2014start a session, help her breathe, explore what\u2019s really behind the drinking and the hunger?"
